"5 stars, you can have anything you want at ..., doesn't fit but you get it.Both breaky and burger/handhelds, bring it. Obviously issues with being able to choose, not cool, first food world problems.We started with the potato puck appetizer, good , it's fried potatoes and cheese , I mean, no brainer. A smidge pricey for the two disc, I know, but for 11$, it's not worth it ($3 each would, just saying) The main course, ah, so good, thank you staff at gb! My cheeseburger was delicious, pink, perfect. The char flavor, chef kiss! The fries, also top shelf. Totally on price. chicken and waffles, well this was my issue, this combo went so well together, I felt my burger was being overshadowed, which wouldn't have been justified. Great malt in that waffle. Crab po boy and chicken sandwich were also notable, but I didn't personally try them.I could see coming here strictly for breakfast or going half and half, being right Either way.Parking is street, good luck with that weather prevailing, but this part of main street is fun , so make a day/night/brunch/linner eats kinda of moment.",5.0,1
"We have come here serval times and each time has been great. Solid service, great food, and quick turn around time as well. It can get really busy on the weekends so heads up there may be a wait! Otherwise on a Thursday it was a 5 min wait for a booth and no wait for the bar. We ordered:- potato, pancake- Chicken and waffles Yum! My family has been here for 100 years  i look forward to coming here when I visit. Enjoy!!",5.0,1

Cute restaurant but food was just A-Ok. Roasted veggie salad was just fine-- veggies could have been warmer and more flavorful. Pork banh mi sandwich was tasty but didn't taste authentic. Corn beef hash was good.,3.0,0

"Food fresh and excellent.  I had breakfast, hash and eggs.  Homemade hash was very good, always an indicator for a breakfast spot.  Nice location on Main Street in Great Barrington.  Very walkable town.",5.0,1
"This a great place to grab brunch in the heart of town. We were seated right away and the service was incredibly friendly. The food was absolutely delicious - we had the corned beef hash meal, the 2 eggs with sausage meal, coffee, and fresh squeezed orange juice. Everything tasted liked it was made from the freshest of ingredients :)I'll definitely be stopping by here again when I'm in the area and I highly recommend.",5.0,1
"Discovered GB eats after we asked for recommendations from a waitress at a different restaurant, & we opted to have dinner here. While it wasn't our first choice for dinner that night, I was pleasantly surprised by our dining experience! To start, the menu here is extensive, providing all day breakfast favorites as well as more savory lunch and dinner options. I opted for The Basic (2 eggs, sausage patties, mixed greens, and sourdough toast) and honestly this was a lot of food for $10.99. The food itself wasn't mindblowing or life changing by any means, but it was decent! And it was exactly what I needed since I wasn't super hungry. My boyfriend ordered the steak frites, and it also was decent. The steak had a bit of a hamburger-y taste to it, but could be masked by the onions. Definitely have to commend them for their fresh OJ though - it had the perfect amount of sweetness!Overall, the food is pretty decent for cafe/diner food, and the servers were kind. That's really all we could ask for after a ski trip.",4.0,1

"Great lunch with my girls today. First time we've ever been. Diverse menu, friendly staff, and the food was so good. Can't wait to go back.",5.0,1
Oooo this is myyyy kind of restaurant!!! Each meal was amazing and they serve generous portion sizes. I love the variety of food items: from salads and burgers to shakshuka and the pork banh mi. They seem to have something for everyone. Our waitress was extremely friendly and gave great recommendations. Also love their selection of lattes. I got the London fog which was perfect. I would definitely go here again!,5.0,1
A menu that ranges from schnitzel to calamari means that the place is kinda promiscuous. A Main Street coffee shop vibe for the only place in town that is reliably open every day of the week. Very popular as a result so the place was jammed. Probably best to order a breakfast dish -- the banh mi (pulled pork) was tasty albeit lacking presentation.,3.0,0
"Stopped in for a late lunch. early dinner. We hit the restaurant at the perfect time. No waiting and super fast service. Order included, Appetizer: ""French Potato Cakes"" and the ""Crock of Beef Chili"". The potato cakes were extremely bland, salt and pepper were definitely needed. The chili was very good and had an herb in it, that I couldn't quite place. Next, I had the ""GB Burger"", as described: ""battered deep fried steak burger stuffed with crumbled blue cheese and bacon drizzled with sriracha served with lettuce, tomato, red onion, and house aioli on a brioche roll"". I was amazed at how good this burger was! Excellent flavor, cooked perfectly, plenty of blue cheese! If I hadn't had the potato cake and chili to start, I would've ordered a second ""GB Burger""! It was that good. I had a side of truffle and parmesan fries, which were just ok. Salt and pepper was called for again. The burger and chili were the reason for the five star review. Our server was very nice, but wasn't completely focused on our needs. Luckily, I don't ask for much.I would go again, just to get that ""GB Burger"".......",5.0,1
"""Baby blankets and baby shoes, baby slippers, baby spoons, walls of baby blueI eat for two, walk for two, breathe for two now""(Natalie Merchant and 10,000 Maniacs)GB Eats is a very cool and funky neighborhood breakfast and lunch joint. Its located inside a big commercial retail building at 284 Main and shares that address with a number of other restaurants. We walked in for a meal shortly after 12, and the place was pretty  crowded. Most of the main dining room was full, most of the counter seats were taken, as were most of the tables in the back of the dining room. We were offered a choice of two counter seats and a table in the back which we accepted.We ordered a waffle ($9 plus a $1 compote add on), Chili Rancheros ($13), and an iced coffee ($3).My Chili Rancheros was one of the best breakfast dishes I've had in a very long time. It included two sunny side up eggs, toasted corn tortillas, house-made beef chili, white cheddar, black beans & corn, avocado, salsa and sour cream, served with home fries or mixed greens. I knew it would be a filling dish, so I passed on the home fries and convinced myself I was going healthy with the mixed greens.The eggs, the chili, the corn tortillas, avocado, and salsa worked so well together, It was freaking delicious!Service was fine, and one odd thing that should be mentioned is the location of the restroom. You have to get a key on a wooden stick from the cashier, then leave the restaurant and walk down the hall toward the movie theater to find their two bathrooms on the left. Then you'll either return the key to the hostess, or pass it over to the next person in line, with the expectation that they will return it.Bottom line is that the food, atmosphere, menu, and pricing are all very good, and contributed to our very positive lunch experience.",5.0,1
"Our new favorite breakfast spot!!  Breakfast is served ALL DAY!  Located in the heart of downtown Great Barrington is this awesome restaurant.  The staff is super friendly and the service is quick!  The food is delicious, reasonably priced & exceptional portions!  Their omelettes are made with the freshest of ingredients & packed with flavor.  We're planning on going back soon the check out their lunch & dinner menu too!",5.0,1
"Out of Towners looking for a place to eat before skiing & stumbled upon GB Eats! So happy we did. The food was delicious, service was quick & the staff was so friendly.  They has great music playing and the diner was cozy & cute.  We will definitely be back.",5.0,1
"The service is absolutely amazing. The servers are friendly and talkative, but in a chill way. Not overbearing at all. Wonderful coffee and sweets and the food is to die for. Really good elevated American food. I recommend the schnitzel sandwich, kale Caesar, chili, and any egg dish. Other food is great as well that's just off the top of my head. You really can't go wrong. They do beer and seasonal cocktails that are so cool too!! Hurry over as fast as possible.",5.0,1

"Stopped here for breakfast and the whole family was satisfied. Busy place on a Saturday morning. We sat right down but people after us had to wait a bit. The food was certainly above par. Fresh and delicious. The eggs Benedict sitting on fried potatoes was really superb.A little on the expensive side for breakfast, but when the food is clearly fresh, local, and well made it's hard to complain. We would definitely come back if we are in town again.",5.0,1

"We were very impressed with the cinnamon apple cake and Harney & Sons tea selection at GB eats. The staff were clearly very busy and they were cheerfully polite both times we visited.

We had breakfast here the morning after a show at Tanglewood. Very neat place with friendly staff. It was pretty busy so it took a little bit of time but overall not bad. My omelette was runny and no American cheese so I had to rough it with mozzarella. There are lots of options in the area so maybe next time we will try something else.,3.0,0

"Super chill spot with all kinds of options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or just a cafe break with some coffee and a pastry. I went all in and got the burger named after the restaurant. Deep-fried steak patty??? It's a miracle I made it home after dinner, but it was worth it in the end. Everything came to the table hot and fresh.",5.0,1
"Food here was fine, however the service was the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant (seriously, not an exaggeration). So bad this is the first time I've written a yelp review because I felt it necessary to warn others. Stopped here on a road trip because the food looked good and reviews looked decent, I recommend you steer clear! Especially if you are a young adult or you have a family, this restaurant does not care about you or your children and will treat you like garbage. I went with my partner, we are both young adults. We received horrible service the entire time, our waitress was never available and it took ages for them to come take our orders or bring over a glass of water. The waitress was very snappy with us, I don't expect servers to be peppy all the time but at least being polite would've been nice. I do not ever expect food to come out quickly, even though the food was the one thing that did because a different waitress dropped it off. Hostess was incredibly rude and snarky, as was the waitress we had. I wish I had gotten their names. We were already planning on leaving no tip as our waitress never even came over to do anything except take our order and throw the check on the table. I take tipping very seriously, and I always tip servers well, so for me to feel this way I must assure you the service was abominable. This is the first time in my life I have NOT tipped. When the waitress dropped the check on the table we noticed it was just the ticket the kitchen gets for our food order with numbers scribbled on the back in pen along with 20% and a new total next to it. I think it's unprofessional to not show any of the tax amounts or a breakdown of the prices at your restaurant, and it seemed very shady to us what that 20% meant so my partner went to inquire with the hostess. They claimed that it was a mandatory 20% tip if you are a minor to which we responded, ""we are both 21"". They thought we were 17 years old. First of all, I'm not sure it's even legal for them to require minors to tip 20%. Second of all, the conclusion I came to is that either they thought we were 17 the whole time and purposefully gave us crappy service because they ""knew"" we'd be forced to tip them 20% anyways (so shady!), OR they knew their service was so crappy and we wouldn't leave a tip so they tried to trick us into thinking that was the total amount of the check (hence the scrawled pen on the back with no real indication of what the true prices were) and they thought we wouldn't be confident enough to go speak up for ourselves. I will also say that I went to use the bathroom after and returned the key to the front and heard our waitress and the hostess loudly gossiping about us. Very tasteless. I get complaining to your coworkers, I really do, but maybe wait until you have a private moment instead of whining loudly to the entire restaurant while the people you are complaining about are still in the vicinity. Either way, if you are looking for a nice spot for a date if you're in your teens or early twenties, do not come here because they will treat you very poorly. As well as if you have children don't come here because I personally would not support a business that believes that kind of model of service is okay.",1.0,0
"Born and bred local here. The ""diner"" used to actually be a traditional diner with traditional diner food. Sadly, it has become another restaurant which caters to the tourists, by adding avocado and arugula to at least 80% of the items on the menu. My co-worker and I received gift cards from someone for Christmas so we decided to give it a try as we hadn't been there in a long time. We tried to call there to place a to-go order two times allowing the phone to ring 20 times each time without an answer. We then decided to go there and eat. We were not greeted when we walked in and finally after asking about a table we were told it would be a 25 minute wait even though there we at least 5 open tables and only two couples waiting before us. We then decided to place a to-go order and wait for it. We asked if we could put the orders on separate checks as we had two separate gift cards. That seemed to be an inconvenience to the waitress who was incredibly rude. In the end, the food wasn't bad. But, the service was lacking. Unfortunately, I will not be going back there.",2.0,0
"Yum! This place did not disappoint. The food was great. I ordered the crab cake benedict. YummyMy friend had the grilled cheese which was made with local sourdough bread and another had an omelet which he said was good. We also ordered some duck wings that were incredibly tasty and the churro beignets are a must order.The service was decent. The waitress got one order wrong but apologized profusely. It's really loud in the place so that was prolly the reason she got it wrong. We also had a bit of a wait to get in, about 20 minutes. Finally the restroom is down the hall and they make you grab a key on a whisk. I held it with a napkin since I don't know how many germs is on that thing. If you're in Great Barrington I highly recommend this place.",5.0,1
Breakfast is great. Love that there is the option to have salad rather than home fries. Staff is always friendly and accommodating.,4.0,1
"After a long trip to the scenic area, we were hungry and stumbled upon this gem. The calamari was nice and crispy, while the roasted brussels sprouts with bacon killed! We got the GB burger, which was cooked to perfection and the bun was buttery, without signs of sogginess. Aside from that, they have an extensive breakfast menu. Prices were good too!",4.0,1
"The service was very attentive & helpful. Our food was delicious. I got the Brussels Sprout Salad & was very pleased with the dish. The menu was a bit on the smaller side which is fine when the food was this good. My only criticism was that on the menu there was a request to not alter any of the dishes. I understand that while this makes things more complicated for the cooks, that some people with allergies or whatnot wouldn't be comfortable. (I have a sensitivity to lemon & I had to request a different dressing for my own health & this note made me feel hesitant to do so. I would like to note that they made this alteration for me with no issue!) It is a bit loud in there, but honestly that is a good sign that business is doing great for them. I am also very glad that I got a hot chai latte on my way out, it was amazing!",4.0,1

"We liked our breakfast here, didn't love it. There is nothing wrong with the food.  There are some creative options too, especially compared to other breakfast offerings in the area.  Everything was, just ok - nothing stands out though. Coffee was hot and strong.  Good for me - extra creamer and sugar needed for the rest of the table.  We didn't get any refills offered while we ate.  One person at the table got a custom Chai drink and liked it well enough. Eggs Benedict over potato pancakes were pretty good. Poached eggs were prepared well. Custom omelet was fine - eggs in the omelet were thin and dry - a bit over cooked.  Quinoa Pesto Bowl with poached eggs was under seasoned.  The quinoa wasn't hot and the whole dish needed a ton of salt and pepper. The pesto was nice but that was the only flavor.  Dish needed some texture too - it was all kinda mush.  We had the house made chicken sausage patty with the bowl.  The patty had good flavor but was super over cooked and dry.  Did ok with it if it was mixed up in the quinoa bowl. Ordered the $4 biscuit on the side.  It was pretty good - soft and flaky.  Came with a sweet homemade jam.  The individual packaged butters didn't have any flavor though. It was a busy spot on a Sunday but the staff managed the wait and crowd just fine.  Servers were friendly and efficient (minus coffee refills). The young women bussing tables was SUPER attentive. One strange thing - the check came with a total price written on the back but no itemized pricing.  We went with it and trusted the waitress but I found it really odd. In the end, a fine breakfast.  Wouldn't mind eating here again.",3.0,0
"We had to wait a little to get into this gem of a eatery and it was worth it!  We all had different things like breakfast and lunch items.  Hard to please everyone in my family and we all walked out with smiles and full bellies.

"I wish I could give them 3 or 4 stars but I just can't and NOT because of the service, surprisingly. The food was substandard at best. I asked the server if the home fries were made to order and she said ""Yes, of course!"" I'm confident that they aren't. They are hard and crumbly and they actually snapped in my fingers when I broke 4 of them. The French toast was doughy, as though it was either battered too much or not cooked enough.The 3 egg omelette was... bland and flavorless. The absolute best part about my order was getting the check. It's sad because this place was recommended by someone who has run restaurants for decades and I'll have to let them know that I was disappointed. Now I'm off to find something to eat because I found this meal unappetizing",2.0,0

"Servers were nice but the food was bad. My pancakes were still raw (legit batter oozing out of the middle). I only ordered the pancakes because the original dish I came here for, which actually is on the menu on their website but no longer on the menu in the restaurant, wasn't available without bacon. Served mentioned it won't be available at all in the next few days. I also got a side of an egg over hard and it was definitely not over hard. The yolk was still undercooked and oozing out so couldn't eat that either. I also ordered the chocolate chai with a shot of expresso and it tasted like milk with cocoa powder - no chai taste, no coffee taste, and no sweet chocolatey taste. The home fries were crispy but so so so bland. Not sure if it was a new cook in the kitchen or an off day, but can't recommend based on my experience. I told the server about the pancakes and didn't get charged for them which is nice all things considered, but I don't think the eggs or coffee were worth the money either.",1.0,0

"This is a lively restaurant with a lot of character (and characters). The wait staff are all at the top of their game -- from relentless practice in this consistently busy spot. The menu presents a wide range for every taste, from Southwest-inspired items to Del-Mar-Va crabcakes, and every dish is crafted with a GB Eats spin. I have only good experiences here, and while the staff are hurried here, they have never been brusque nor rude. But the food . . . GB Eats has found the elusive balance of great flavors and creative combinations but without -- apparently -- the usual off-the-charts sodium. For a fun and fine dining experience in a pointedly casual atmosphere, this is the spot in Great Barrington.",4.0,1

"I've just hopped back on yelp after a 7-year hiatus in hopes of saving people the wait and sparing them from this *incredibly* over-rated place. I will tell you the truth: I didn't have high hopes for this place to begin with, but I was SHOCKED at how bad the food was. After resigning myself to waiting 20 minutes at the bequest of a somewhat curt hostess, my toddler and I sat down, expecting something decent. A sweet waitress took our order, and brought out fries quickly-ish (10 min) for my hungry daughter...Fries:   The fries were already pretty disappointing even though fries are pretty hard to mess up. Slightly stale, bland, dry, mealy texture. Next came our dishes -- the crab cake sandwich and the Salmon quinoa bowl. Salmon quinoa bowl: I sort of did a double take when it came out because the salmon-quinoa bowl just looked so....sad. It was a small portion, with yellowed and wilted arugula, flanked by a few meager pieces of avocado covered in big black and brown spots.  Nothing was seasoned. At all. Even the quinoa tasted like it had been sitting around. The salmon was fresh, thankfully. Crab-cake sandwich: Now onto my crab cake sandwich. I want to preface this by saying I have literally never had a crab cake I didn't like. I took one bite of this sandwich and gagged, having to spit it out. Something tasted wrong. off. Like an old sock. I don't know what made it taste this way -- the crab might have been fine. But the dish was not. I ended up sending this dish back, as well as requesting some avocado for my daughter that wasn't covered in brown spots (it was replaced by another avocado with more black spots). I decided to get the egg and black bean quinoa bowl to replace the dish I sent back. Egg-black bean-corn-quinoa bowl: Again, I was shocked by the meager, sad looking portion, and the extreme tastelessness of all ingredients. Sad black beans that seemed like the came directly from can to plate. Frozen tasteless corn. The saddest tasteless salsa, and completely unseasoned plain poached eggs. Service: Our waitress was sweet, and the manager took my food back. But she didn't seem all that pleased and certainly wasn't apologetic. However, because it was so crowded it was almost impossible to get anyone's attention. I tried calling after people as they ran away. I think I may have been unintentionally making faces of shock and disgust, so I don't blame them for somewhat avoiding our table after that. Long story short: This restaurant has a completely inexplicable following. It doesn't seem to make any effort at all due to its loyal client base -- I am so confused about why there is a wait!! I would recommend this restaurant seriously look at food quality, or that customers consider bringing their business to some of the other tasty options around Great Barrington: Bizen, Baba Louie's..pretty much anywhere but here.",1.0,0

The waitress was cool. She can sell a special ( or I was really hungry). The coffee bar is the best. They have a such a great selection. They even have boozy cocoa and coffee. Be careful, the adult cocoa could get you faded lol. The food was really good. The potatoes aren't that great to me. They were pretty bland. They give you salt pepper and ketchup though . They are a perfect mix of a hippy coffee bar and mom and pop diner. Give it a try. I'm sure you'll like it.",5.0,1
"GB Eats was our luckiest find on our second trip to the Berkshires. My husband and I originally tried getting a table at The Well. We literally stood in the middle of the restaurant waiting for someone to acknowledge our presence. We got so frustrated by the rude service that we just left. Hangry and PO'd, we started wandering Main Street looking for a place for fuel. Perhaps it was the magic of Christmas guiding us, but we stumbled upon GB Eats. Having just been ousted from the Inn (aka The Well), GB Eats became our saving manger.The staff at GB Eats is second-to-none. They're so friendly and make you feel like family. The service would have been enough to warrant a great review, but then comes the food. De. Lish. Probably the best diner food I've had in years. I can't think of a single aspect of this place that wasn't pure perfection. The next time we visit Great Barrington, we will DEF stop by GB Eats again.",5.0,1
So yummy! Me and my friend stopped here for lunch and were very impressed. She got the BLT and I got the avocado pesto sandwich. Both were delicious. The staff was super friendly and followed Covid procedures,5.0,1
Definitely found our new go to spot whenever we're in GB! Amazing food and friendly service!,5.0,1
"Went for brunch with my lady friends. Small place in a busy area, very quaint as my friend would say. Everything on the menu was delicious. From the healthy options (avocado, quinoa, seeds/nuts concoction) to the more guilty pleasures(poached eggs drenched in hollandaise with bacon), everything we ordered was delicious. Mimosa was around $10 but served in a ginormous glass but it was crisp, with the right amount of alcohol that no one was getting messy during brunch. There was a bit of a wait, maybe 20 minutes or so but nothing ridiculous. Space is small but staff is friendly and very efficient. Would definitely return if I were to return to the area!Street parking was tricky since it was a busy weekend (think it was Labor Day weekend?), metered parking.",5.0,1
"I love coming to great Barrington  because it's such a beautiful town. This is my go to for brunch/breakfast when I'm visiting from nyc. The croissant breakfast sandwich is SO good and the omelette are fresh and delicious. There is rarely ever a wait and my fiancé loves the coffee. Sometimes it's a big warm inside, but I could careless since the food is so delicious. Staff is friendly.",5.0,1
"Amazing spot! GB Eats serves breakfast all day, but their lunch/dinner menu is solid. They also serve beer and wine. And have a coffee/espresso bar. I had the roasted vegetable salad. But to be honest, I had a lot of trouble deciding what I wanted. Everything looked good: eggs benedict, bahn mi, pesto quinoa bowl, waffles, eggs, corned beef hash. The options go on, and there is something for everyone on this menu. The roasted vegetable salad was the best salad I've ever had. It had frisse greens, roasted parsnips, carrots, and brussel sprouts, feta, toasted pumpkin seeds, and it was perfectly dressed with a balsamic drizzle. It was light and crisp and so fresh. My husband had the burger with an egg and sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were amazing. My friend had the pesto avocado quinoa bowl topped with two poached eggs, which also looked so good. Everything was amazing and fresh. This place hit the spot after a long day before hitting the road to go home.",5.0,1
Excellent service. One of the more aesthetically pleasing and tasty Bloody Mary's in the area. Only had breakfast but the food is excellent. Would recommend the corn beef hash!,5.0,1
"Epic breakfast. My god, why do their eggs seem so different from everyone else's? Great morning sunlight as well. Only thing that could have made it nicer would have been if they let the breeze in from outside. I never understand places that are so excitable over covid masks but are hermetically sealed when they don't have to be.",5.0,1
"Great little spot for breakfast. Bit of a strange entry situation but don't let that deter you. The staff was friendly and accommodating on early Saturday morning. I like the fact that they offer alternatives to dairy like soy & almond milk. My almond milk cappuccino was awesome!  The coffee is of really good quality- strong but smooth. They serve Berkshire Mountain bakery breads; very high-quality and excellent flavor.  Solid variety of breakfast choices with modern takes on tradition as well as influences like Southern California or vegan options.  I had the French potato cake eggs Benedict, no Canadian bacon, avocado and sharp cheddar. The potato cakes were dreamy- buttery, creamy w a slight crunch. Everything cooked perfectly seasoned well and a nice portion.  They're thick cut bacon was a fan of my table but not the sausage so much.  The build your own omelette with smoked Gouda unfortunately was in chunks and never properly melted which wasn't so great & the omelet was overcooked. Cool background music. Great for families, locals, or if you're just up for the weekend. A few little minuses:   The restroom situation is strange- you need a key, leave the restaurant walk down the hall to this creepy dark awkward one stall bathroom.  Our server was a little flustered - we kept asking for water and it was not delivered until the check came. The booth seating is slightly uncomfortable.",4.0,1
"Had a great experience here for lunch during the Covid era. We came in with my family, a group of five, and while they didn't have seating right outside the restaurant, they did have a shared back patio with some other local restaurants, and you could order takeout and eat out there. This ended up working pretty well, although all of our food did subsequently end up coming in takeout containers. That being said, we were able to order drinks, appetizers, and entrées which were all hot and delicious when they came out. I had an omelette, which was pretty typical breakfast food. Some other members of our group had their crabcakes, which they raved about. I'll also make a blog for the sweet potato fries, which were surprisingly delicious. I'm knocking a star off for some logistical issues, including forgetting some condiments (notably the butter and jam that was supposed to come with the biscuits!) and having to go back and forth for utensils and water, but overall we had a good experience and will come back if in the area.",4.0,1
the crab cake po boy is probably the most delicious thing i have ever eaten!!! such a cute spot too,5.0,1
"I was not a fan of The Neighborhood Diner and can count on one hand the times I dined there in the 11 summers that I have spent in the area.They had been there for 18.But I am a huge fan of the new GB eats. While my son loved his Banh mi , I adored the ample roasted vegetable salad showcasing roasted butternut squash, Brussel sprouts, feta and roasted pepitas on a bed of probably the freshest, most flavor able mixed greens that I have ever had. Their burgers and sandwiches are modern and use local provisions such as sourdough from Berkshire Mountain bakery. Breakfast is served until 3 and they seem to have quite a selection of house made desserts and ice cream from The Scoop in Lenox. Interesting is the North African dish called Shakshuka, an iron skillet with 3 eggs poached in stewed tomatoes, potatoes, feta and peppers. Israelis love this dish and you will too !!This is an upscale bistro type of menu in a casual cafe setting and is a welcomed addition to a town that has recently been depleted of its many dining options. Prices are very fair with the above mentioned sandwiches and salads being in the 10-12 dollar range.There is something for everyone at GB Eats and I hope that they have a successful first year.",5.0,1
Love this place. My go to is Steak and eggs and am always pleased with the quality of the food and it's preparation. Never overdone. The waitstaff is always attentive and super nice even at their busiest. Working in the service industry myself I know it's not always easy. Thanks Ladies you always make my day.,5.0,1
"Breakfast, as the saying goes, is the most important meal of the day. Today, I had an important and delicious breakfast at GB eats (formerly The Neighborhood Diner.) While the shell of the space is the same, the menu and quality are big step up and the decor is clean and simple. Let's start with the coffee...dark and hot just the way I like it. They also have coffee drinks, but I prefer it black no sugar...just like my soul, and this was soulful coffee.Next, I had the corned beef hash with poached eggs and whole wheat toast. While typically corned beef hash is canned or even dog food-like, this was the R.E.A.L. D.E.A.L. The eggs with deep orange yoke, came perfectly and gently poached. The toast...Berkshire Mountain Bakery bread simply prepared and lightly buttered. My dining companion had the Huevos Rancheros which he said were better than others he has had locally. I got just a taste, and the chili was rich and meaty.GB eats is just what one would want in The Berkshires for a diner breakfast. I used to like The Neighborhood Diner as a 'guilty pleasure', and would leave feeling a bit greasy. I left this morning from GB eats ready to take on the day.",5.0,1

Great sandwiches, fries, fried chicken and waffles. Good amount of seatings indoor without feeling crowded. Good service and quick. Would definitely be coming back here. This is a building issue otherwise would be 4 stars, but bathrooms could be nicer and should be accessible without using an actual key attached to a batter beater. Cute, but really not sanitary, especially these days.",5.0,1
We had breakfast here and were all very pleased with our meals. The shakshuka was absolutely wonderful - one of the best breakfasts I've had at a restaurant in recent history.

"I don't understand the negative reviews because I have to say this was an excellent lunch. I had the Pork Schnitzel with bacon Jam on Ciabatta bread. Great combination of flavors! The schnitzel was crisp and perfectly cooked, not dry. The bacon jam was awesome and the ciabatta was just the right amount of bread and crisp on the outside, soft inside. The sweet potato fries were perfectly sweet and crisp with just the right amount of salt. My friend had the GB burger and said it was perfectly cooked, served on sourdough bread. Service was considerate and spot on.  Couldn't ask for more.",5.0,1

"THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD. I was at Great Barrington for a short weekend getaway and I was amazed when I stumbled upon this place. GB EATS' got a great menu, fun ambience, and delicious food. It's a small restaurant but well-designed, so it does not feel crowded at all. The servers are super friendly and gave good recommendations. The menu offers a lot of options, ranging from healthy egg combos to mountain-like sweet shakes. My boyfriend and I had the eggs with corned beef hash, the basic, and beignets. The egg combos were an extraordinary start to our morning. They were fulfilling yet refreshing at the same time. I also thought it was cool that you get to choose the type of bread in the combo. The sweet beignets with spicy chocolate sauce is heavenly made, and a perfect dessert to share with your friends/family. I have to say, even with all the fantastic brunch restaurants in Boston, GB EATS is near the top of my list.",5.0,1

"So I just walked into GB eats and was excited to try it for lunch while I am in town (I'm a seasonal resident but come several times a year) I just had EXACTLY the same reception as another reviewer had here... I was going to dine solo at the counter or a 2 seater booth in back by kitchen door and was met with the most rude server!!! She said ""no you can't, we have a 45 minute wait"" really ??? I didn't see a soul waiting around, not a single diner, and she just barked at me with a totally un-Berkshire like welcome!!!Went across the street to the relocated Fuel and don't know if I will ever step foot into GB eats again!NO STARS for you but had to leave one to post my review",1.0,0

"GB Eats contributes to making Great Barrington, MA a foodie destination worth taking.  Food is locally sourced which is something we look for as there's lots of farms and great places that make all kinds of specialties in the region.I started with the Dirty Chai which is a Chai Tea with an Espresso shot.  I am glad I did as the aroma and taste of mixing the espresso with the Chai worked well, I would have had a 2nd cup but I just had an iced coffee about an hour earlier from Fuel (nearby coffee shop that's moving across the street into a bigger store front in a couple of weeks). I will get it again!  Then we shared Asian Duck Wings and Parmesan Truffle fries.  I love duck but will likely pass on this app in the future are there are other good choices. They were meaty but they were fried and not quite what I expected. There was nothing wrong with them and they were good but i expected a duck version of chicken wings and its my fault as i should have asked about the preparation. The truffle fries were really good. For my main dish I had the brisket sandwich with greens. The lettuce was as fresh as you can get and better than expected and the sandwich was delish with a side of au jus to dip it in. My family got the Kale salad and the chicken sandwich which they enjoyed and said they'd get again. We did not get dessert but they had cakes and pies that looked good. Next time I plan to try the Peanut butter pie. I also noticed some good looking home made cookies including salted caramel which looked especially appealing. We opted for the Soco Creamery to get ice cream. The service was passable. They were pleasant and nice, they're nice people which is important (to me). Nothing great and not terrible but this isn't NYC so lower your expectations and just relax and you'll be fine.Bottomline, we have been here several times and look forward to going back.",5.0,1

"In town visiting and decided to have brunch here. They seated us rather quickly even though it was a little busy, which was nice given the amount of people meandering around looking for a place to eat. Upon looking over the menu I thought that crab cakes Benedict sounded delicious but they were recommending the potato cakes Benedict as their speciality so I asked if I could have the potato cakes Benedict but with crab cakes added (I was more than happy to pay the up charge for the crab cakes) but was met with a stern ""NO"" we don't do substitutions or custom orders. I don't really understand how people stay in business treating customers like that anymore. You are there to serve the customer. It's not like this is a 5 star Michelin restaurant where there is a renowned world class chef in the kitchen...nope...this is a line cook. So I said ""fine. I'll take the potato cakes Benedict"" and expected it to be like a latke or potatoes that had been battered a little and fried to make them crispy and like a patty in place of the English muffin...but nope...just a pile of breakfast potatoes. On top of that the food had no taste. The potatoes were like mush. One of the egg yolks was hard. The hollandaise sauce had no flavor. The only good thing in it was the bacon (actual bacon not Canadian bacon). Like another reviewer said, no sides came with this eggs Benedict either...but I suppose I know why, cause in place of putting the potatoes on the side, they were under the eggs and just called a different name. What a sham. My husband also got the cowboy burger and while he said it was cooked well and was juicy, he said that neither the hamburger patty nor the French fries had any seasoning on them, no salt, no pepper, nada. It's really too bad, could be a cute place...",2.0,0

Found this place on Yelp and with all the 5* reviews and the menu online I was looking forward to trying out this place being in GB. Well the menu in person didn't have half the good stuff on it. Pretty empty at lunchtime-I ordered the crab eggs benedict. I still don't know what it was I was served. There was so much extra herbs or spices added to it who knows if it was crab. Tasted totally funky and I was nervous this was that old trick to cover-up food past it's peak. Happy I didn't get sick. Indifferent service.

In sum, GB Eats serves delicious food, generous portions, and all for very reasonable prices. We had wonderful coffee and three-egg omelets, which were the best tasting we'd ever had. Included in the $9 price per omelet was up to three toppings (I chose caramelized onion, mushrooms, and white cheddar cheese; he had tomato, feta cheese, and mushrooms--but there are even more choices). Also included in the price was toast from a highly respected local bakery and roasted or grilled red potatoes from heaven! Many diners were having sweet items such as pancakes, and there is a full menu from which to choose. We'll be going back soon to select from their lunch and dinner menus.",5.0,1

"As noted, the food is good, not amazing, but we were left with a positive impression.  Based on that, we would go back......but for...  The attitude and commercial policies.  These did not leave a positive impression.Sorry, maybe it is the little things:  $2.50/ for a small (6oz?) cup of stale, plain old American, black coffee with no refills.  $2.25 (I think) for an ordinary iced tea with no refills.    ...no refills, yet the wait staff circulates with a pot of coffee offering to ""warm your coffee"" (like many places do) but they do not mention there is a $2.50 charge.  ...$2.50 to top off half a cup of coffee?  A bit rich for my taste.Only upon receiving the bill did we realize these things.  Result:  $17 for two simple dishes, $22 for coffee and tea.   Yes, it is a restaurant's right to run their business as they wish.  It is also our, and your, right to eat elsewhere if we wish.   We would have appreciated the courtesy of being informed of their policies and prices ahead of time.  Upon checking out, we politely told the manager that these policies and not being informed of them left us with a very bad impression.  The total apathy was truly impressive.  Oscar winning performance.  This is when we knew......we would not be returning.  There are several similar American diner style restaurants in the area, with equally good food.  We heartily recommend that one consider these options.",2.0,0

"I am ready to write my review since this place was consistent with a good food that we went for three times in the past half a year. 1st time we came it was on a Sunday night and the place was empty, but we were greeted by a very nice waitress Sam that seated us right away. We end up ordering different foods because we weren't sure what we will like and we had kids with us. Everything tasted great but our favorite were Berkshire Melt and Crab Cakes Benedict. Second time we came we had a different waitress that wasn't so friendly but food was still consistently good and that is what matters for us. Past Sunday we went back and Sam was working again and she was fantastic so this made me want to write a review for this restaurant. I would like to see this place more busy because portions are good and taste great and the price is just right.",5.0,1

"Looking for a breakfast place to eat I'd suggest Botanica or Rio cafe. The only reason I gave one star is for the super friendly gentleman that sat us, gave us menus and made sure the sun wasn't bothering us. The breakfast menu was amazing lots of choices I was so looking forward to enjoying a lovely breakfast with mom only problem was the absence of either of the 2 waitresses. We were there for about 15 min not a glass of water was brought to us meanwhile as another table was sat the waitress was right over to ask them if they wanted anything to drink. Very disrespectful as I said lets go eat somewhere else I apologized to the nice gentleman that we were leaving because of such situation and as i pointed out that the 2 waitress were just standing there talking. I don't know how good the food really is but wish I did. I really hope there customer service improves as I have family here and visit often. What a shame.",1.0,0
"Chose this coffee shop for a coffee to go, walk in to see the entire eat at bar with dirty dishes, tables dirty with dishes, a server arguing with another server. Complete chaos and no one greeted us until we walked up to the counter. Ordered a cappuccino and iced latte to go, ask for less milk in latte and watch the woman use her hand to strain the milk out of the cup into the sink. Point blank ask her if she just used her hand and she says yes but that she can make a fresh latte if we wanted her to and said her hands were clean. Poor service and unsanitary, do not recommend.",1.0,0
"We were a large group and had called ahead.  We still ended up waiting for at least 20 minutes upon arriving.  They also couldn't accommodate the food allergies in our group.  On top of that, they had run out of Challah for french toast, which was one of the reasons we chose this restaurant.  To their credit, the chef was able to make French Toast out of other bread options, but it was quite a bit of a downer.",1.0,0
"Had the same experience as May. Went in with 3 people and were met by an extremely rude server who told us there was a wait even though there were tons of empty tables.

Great eats in Great Barrington! I had the pork bang mi sandwich. Delicious pulled pork served on a ciabatta roll with fresh mint and other herbs. The side of fries was crisp and cooked perfectly. I was very happy with my meal.,5.0,1
"Overall: this place had a LINE before it opened on a MONDAY. If that doesn't tell you about this place then let me convince you with their food. Food: the bread is so killer you can buy it and take it home (which we did). The garlic bread crumbles on the bite in a beautiful cascade. The garlic butter is enough that when it hits your tongue it's pungent but smooth like butter. The pizza toppings chosen weren't my personal favorite but the flatbread crust is what deals the deal. Toppings come and go but the crust base is the epitome of crispy thin with soft bite. Ambience/Decor/Service:Our waitress was incredibly nice answering our multitude of questions about bread, sizes, and condiments. Exquisite service. Plenty of open space with two rooms and not squeezed by too much seating. Really good use of their space.",5.0,1

"We ordered our meals to go on a Friday night. We tried a plain Margherite pizza along with a specialty with fig and prosciutto and greens. We also tried a special linguini pasta for the night with fennel and leeks and sausage which was also tasty. Finally we ordered two cups of soup for the night which was mushroom and eggplant. Overall the meal was good  although being partial to NY, I did feel the pizza was a little lacking even tho it is a different style.",4.0,1
"3.5  Grabbed a bite with our kids, the servers were attentive and food came out pretty quick. Portions of pasta for the kids were generous.The inside is casual, the table we sat at had these folding screens on both sides which I personally didn't love aesthetically. There was some very cool art on the walls. We got sourdough pizza, I couldn't taste sourdough but the pizza was good. I was the one that requested extra cheese because while I like a margarita I enjoy when there is more mozzarella on it. From what I recall they don't offer a regular cheese pizza on the menu but they are willing to make one if you ask.",3.0,0
"Attractive place for pizza, salad, and a few appetizers. I enjoyed the Allegra Salad with greens, pecans, apricots, and figs. The main even here is the thin crusted sourdough pizza. Tiger are several more exotic pizza and toppings but we just went with the margarita pizza  The crust is super thin, kind of crap but a bit chewy at the sane time. The sauce was on the sweet side and there was plenty of it. I enjoyed the pizza but thought it could use some seasoning. Service was fabulous. The young ladies kept checking in on us. Will definitely return.",4.0,1

"The best sourdough pizza you'll have! There's a reason there's hardly a wait under 30 minutes. Be patient with Baba Louie's because the pizza is worth it. The crust is crisp and thin yet still some bounce, perfectly balanced with cheesy goodness and then the sauce... the sauce is just perfect. We had Margherita and melanzane pizzas, would highly recommend both. The Buffalo wings were also delicious. I haven't tried spelt or gluten free pizzas but you can't go wrong here.",5.0,1
"I lived in NY for the last two years and also discovered New Haven pizza. So my point - I've enjoyed about the best pies outside of Chicago and Napoli. And Baba L's ( great name BTW!) holds its own with the best. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the thin sourdough crust. Add your favorite toppings or choose from the numerous variations and you'll be equally pleased too. For me, a pepperoni is the bellwether and it was oh so good. Enjoy!",5.0,1
"After an afternoon of skiing at the mountain we were all craving fresh, hot, pizza! Never been to a pizza joint that used sourdough dough. I really enjoyed the pizza, the kids not as much, but they really liked the sourdough bread. The split pea soup was delicious. We had leftover pizza but my daughter left it inside the ice cream store, bummer! Service was very good. I would gladly return again",3.0,0
"While we've ordered takeout from this restaurant more than once I never understood what everyone was raving about. I discovered the secret to enjoying this wonderful sourdough pizza and the secret is : do not do takeout. For whatever reason, sourdough becomes chewy when reheated. There are so many varieties that the choice will be difficult. You can always fall back on a dull, uninteresting, but still delicious, Margarita style pizza. When served freshly delivered to your table every bite is crazy good. Start with some apps. Nachos supreme and chicken wings are well done! By the way, if you only want to do takeout on the pizza you can do a take and bake where its partially prepared and you finish it off at home or wherever you can find an oven.  They also have daily soup specials, but the last 2 times I visited it was over 90 degrees outside so that was a pass for me.",5.0,1
"Cool pizza spot in Hudson specializing in pizza. The dough is sourdough based, very thin, and more of a cracker style like Di Faras. The toppings are awesome. We also tried a few salads and both were very good. Very good value.",5.0,1
"Lunch b4 tubing in the area.  It was a,very spacious resturant which make us feel make safe cause of covid time. We walked in and immediately got acknowledged by a very nice lady and was seated in no time. We ordered the bake sweet potatoes and was really good. Not greasy like the fried type. Then the baked chicken wings came and was also good no grease. We felt healthier eating all of our sides baked and it didn't not compromised the taste. Ours in dish, the margarita pizza came.  If you like the sauce a little on the salty then sweet side, you will LOVE this pizza. Crust was super crispy.  We were glad we chose this as our lunch. Note the waiting for the food takes awhile so make sure you have enough of time in hand before you have other plans.",5.0,1

"It's a stretch that I even gave this place a single star.if this mediocre, overpriced joint was located near me (Waterbury, CT) it would not last a week. The large Italian community would drum it out of town post haste.A man seated us in a cubby hole near the rear of the dining room.My wife's eggplant & mushroom soup was a small bowl of puree' with no substance. Boring.My salad consisted of a pile of greens in a bowl. Nothing else. No tomatoes, no cucumbers, no onions, no radishes, etc. Just greens. Boring and dumb.I noticed that there were no salt and pepper shakers on the table. That seemed odd, since every restaurant I have ever been in, at a minimum, has always had those two items on the table.I always put some salt on my salad, so I asked for them. But I had to wait a good length of time until I saw our waitress come by.We both ordered lemon seltzer drinks that came from a bottling company. I should have ordered something else.The pizza:We ordered a medium-sized pizza, whch would be considered a small-sized pizza where we live. Disappointment #1I like thin crust pizza, but not when it is like a big round cracker. Disappointment #2We had Canadian bacon for a topping. I had never seen Canadian bacon like what was on that pizza. It looked and tasted like thin, deli-sliced ham. Disappointment #3The sauce was bland. The cheese was forgettable. Disappointment #4 and 5.Overall, the pizza was at best, mediocre. Nothing to write home about. I've had plenty of much tastier (and cheaper) pizzas.Coffee at the close of lunch was OK. No complaints with that. I guess that is what earns my 1 star rating.We did not order dessert.Then came the bill. Here's where things go from bad to worse.The bill indicated 44 dollars and change.I handed my card to the waitress.She came back with my receipt to sign and quickly left for parts unknown.The receipt indicated 82 dollars and change.I could not see the waitress, but since the man who seated us was in sight, I showed this to him.His cute remark was, ""That's how we make money.""I was not amused.He located the waitress, and they went to the cash register and fixed the mistake.The waitress scurried away.He returned with the corrected receipt.No apology from neither him or the waitress.All other restaurants would have apologized and some would have even take something off the bill for the major monetary mistake.Summary:Will we be returning customers to Baba Louie's ?Do chickens have lips ?",1.0,0

With a lot of ingredients and no common sense, shrimps and pineapple ,bacon , onions , cheese and more !! And they did put a horrible green chilli sauce on top, looks like a pesto with ginger ,, anyways the pizza taste like a soup !! I don't like it , I don't recommended , and for sure I'm not coming back , if you have problems with the Hawaiian pizza , we also ordered chicken bbq, and that was even worst .",1.0,0

"Baba Louies is the sport for GB pizza and I get that, but man, is the window for peak pie not suitable for takeout! Seriously, take this holistic review at a grain of salt unless you plan on taking out - it's a whole new ballgame.To preface, my first few patronages to Baba Louie's were in-house and the pizza is exquisite. So much so, I feel the need to backdate the stars on this review because as wonderful as it is in-house, it suffers TREMENDOUSLY when waiting longer than 10 minutes to eat.The thin, tangy, bubbled-over crust becomes stale, cracker-brittle and bitter. The toppings are still exquisite, but some components may becomes gummy, slimy or oily - depending on your pie.My kids loved the Queen Margherita, with high-quality mozz, sauce and a garlic basil EVOO. However, our Dolce Vita suffered from brittle prosciutto, tacky-dry figs, ashy wilted spinach and nary a wisp of rosemary olive oil. We were bummed, and couldn't even gnaw on the bone-dry crusts to subside.So yes, three stars but a fourth for the circumstances unbecoming a pandemic. Still, if you're offering curbside or takeaway, you really should be able to pivot for the transport. Only half the pies we ordered did.",4.0,1
"came here for lunch on our way home from killington after it being recommended to us by a couple of friends and was fairly impressed. for vegan pizza, i was really pleased with the different pizza pies that we got. the staff was very friendly and helpful and honestly i could have ate two whole pies myself (that's how good it was). the place is pretty big so you can have big groups if you wanted to, just parking may be a bit hard as there's only street parking and a tiny parking lot on the side. cute town! definitely recommend!",4.0,1
"Now being from New York it is really hard to find a good Pizzeria. So normally I try to find a place that seems busy and something different. This place used sour dough to make the pizza and I would have to say it was Quite tasty. This was definitely something different. I ordered a small size pizza where I decided to make it my own. I added some fresh garlic, basil, peppers and pepperoni. I think I need to try some of their specialty slices. The issue was we have just eaten and was not very hungry so passing by I knew I just had to give them a try.I really found the nice thin crust of the sourdough pizza to be very good. Personally I think I might've even given them a five star rating if I was really hungry at the time.Next time when we come back we have to try some of the others and I may even change my review to be better. I found the staff to be very friendly and the time it took to make the pizza even though they were busy they were ahead by a couple of minutes to have the pizza ready.They had a very friendly staff. Place also seem nice and clean. For sure will be back to try some of the others.",4.0,1
"A staple of Railroad Street in Great Barrington. Though, the interior decor could use a refresh, and the cocktails might need to step it up to compete with neighboring establishments; you can't go wrong with their delicious Thin-Crust Sourdough Pizzas. The small size is a large personal pizza for a hungry person, and the large is great for 2-3 to share. The margarita pizza, as a baseline, is flavorful and nuanced. The young staff is welcoming and on top of things, even during busy hours. Pro-Tip: the wine by the glass is a healthy pour for the price - so grab a glass of red and settle in for a lovely meal.",4.0,1
Nice staff. I got wings and a salad which was underwhelming for over $30 w/ tip . $10 salad was just lettuce with little flavor to dressing and I didn't finish. Wings a bit soggy barely avg.

"For those of you looking for a good gluten free pizza, steer clear of this place. While their regular pizzas are quite good, their gluten free pizza is truly awful- there is no excuse for selling something this bad, with so many excellent gluten free pizza crust options available. The consistency is like cardboard and is virtually inedible, despite good toppings. We have tried it more than once, hoping the first time was just a one-off bad experience- we've learned our lesson and will not be back, at least not for GF pizza. You can do better, Baba Louie's.",1.0,0

This place has a lot of different specialty pizzas. Pretty interesting even gluten free. Everything is made in-house from the sauce to the dough. Came to this place right after a day of beautiful skiing with it snowing outside.I did give them five stars instead of 4 stars because I had kindly asked them to NOT to put Gorgonzola on my pie but they did it anyway. However they did compliment us on a lovely tiramisu dessert. So they made ends meet.,5.0,1

The sourdough crust is baked perfection. The white sangria was a great compliment. I finished off my meal with a very decadent flourless chocolate torte.

"This was a pretty hip pizza place. We got there on a Sunday right when they opened at 5 and their were already 12 people in line to get in. We were seated fast as were all the parties. Guess they were used to this. Service was fast. Worst part was it was a 90 degree day and NO A/C & NO FANS!!!! Got much hotter from time we arrived cause the pizza oven was heating the place up. We had 'coles creation'. It was pretty good actually. Wish it had, had a bit more dressing as it was pretty dry but overall good. My kids had the pasta and a small cheese and they liked that.",4.0,1
A local favorite! Their gluten free crust is so good too - so happy they are selling in the grocery stores so we can attempt our own pizzas at home. I don't know what's in that Phoebe's Greek salad dressing but it's liquid gold. Dolce Vita + the BBQ chicken are our family go-to's. Thank you babbalouies for making your online/phone orders so easy!

We were told there is a 60 min wait time, we were fine by it. We walked around town a bit, did some quick shopping and came back after 40 mins and they already had a table for us. I usually do the regular good old safe margarita but I really did experiment here with the figs. I was pleasantly surprised. The pizza was thin and the dough was really nice. Must try place!",5.0,1
"I love finding great pizza places outside of NYC.  It's great to find a place like this which prove the point that like 95% of pizza joints in the city are awful or serve complete garbage.This place is far from that.  Yes, it's in Great Barrington, which isn't exactly close to NYC (it's a 2.5 hour drive on a good day).  But it most certainly lives up to its reputation as an excellent pizza establishment.What really makes the pizza stand out here is their use of extremely fresh ingredients, creative executions and the excellent feel of their sourdough dough.  If you're used to eating stupid salty/greasy shit and that's your baseline for pizza flavor, you might find this place to be too bland.  Personally I think this place does a perfect job of combining flavor with nuance.  The texture of the pizza coupled with the solid (yet not overpowering) flavor and saltiness of each slice/pie is what makes this place special.  Case in point - if you're feeling adventurous go order a large pie with two distinct halves.  I tried a couple of combos but the one that really showcased how solid this place was when I ordered one pie that was a classic mahgerita with fresh mozzarella, pepperoni and basil on one side and their Hanna Jo pizza on the other.  The contrast of the two flavors were amazing.  It was great alternating one slice of each flavor to really get a great sense of the freshness of the pizza, the differences in flavor and how they play off one another.The folks here are super friendly and the place is very similar to the inviting feel of the town of Great Barrington.  It's too bad this place is far from NYC, otherwise I'd literally hit this place up several times a week.  It's definitely a place to check out if you're in the area.",5.0,1

"After some leaf-peeping in the Berkshires, I was ready for a fantastic lunch; pizza specifically. After parking and strolling through Great Barrington, I landed at Baba Louie's. And I'm so glad I did. I was met by a friendly, kind young woman upon entering.Small but cozy with an eclectic color scheme and artwork. (I tried hard not to pay attention to the screaming kids breaking glass while their moms sat and ate but it wasn't easy)I ordered a pizza, of course. Half was Isabella Pizzarella and the other half was Melanzana Cardinale. I wish the whole pie was Isabella Pizzarella. It was one of the best pizzas I have had. The sweet potatoes and parsnips were perfect for fall. The small was perfect for one person as I had yummy leftovers to heat up in the hotel microwave. Will definitely go back if I'm ever in the area.",4.0,1
"This place is the literal bomb! They have some killer pizza with amazing flavor combos! If I'm being honest, some of the pizza combos on the menu sounded quite strange but they turned out to be fantastic tasting.

We ordered their daily eggplant special for an app, it didn't even last long enough on the table for me to grab a photo, it was delicious.

"The best and most inventive pizza I ever had! Loved, loved, loved the Isabella! We had two others, but the Isabella was my favorite. Also, we had a Greek salad( large feeds 4 people) was fresh and delicious. Looking forward going back when I'm visiting in the Berkshires. The service was terrific( got us out on time for the movie theater around the corner). If you're up in the area( Great Barrington or Hudson) make sure you stop by and try this place!",5.0,1
Sourdough Pizza?   Yes please!  Stumbled onto this place after a day of sightseeing / walking around Great Barrington on a cloudy October Sunday. Got seated right away and it wasn't a long wait for our tasty mushroom pie (we split a large which was plenty for two people -- we even had takeout for Mom later). The crust is the star here -- but fresh toppings and red sauce were spot on.  Would come back here anytime.,4.0,1

I just don't get it. The crust is super flavorful with a great chew. But the margarita pizza is covered in sauce (way too much sauce) and topped with flavorless cheese. the ordering and prepayment was great but the food simply was not worth it at any price.,2.0,0
"This pizza is life changing. I moved to the east coast to California a few weeks ago and still haven't found brag-worthy Pizza...until I came to Baba Louie's. After a long day of driving and getting settled into our Airbnb, we headed down Main St to grab a bite. I'm so glad that we stopped here! I'm more of a veggie (the more the better) pizza kind of girl, so we ended up with the Bucco (potato, pesto and we added cheese) and a bbq chicken. The chicken pizza was PERFECT. The bbq sauce was beautiful, the spices seemed Thai-inspired which gave it a great kick, the chicken was moist, the crust...the crust was like eating heaven. The potato pizza was delicious as well -- the pesto was great and the cheese was a smart decision. Go here. Eat the pizza. Take pictures and brag to all of your friends. Please.",5.0,1

"Food is very high in quality but the quantity is small.  I didn't order enough for a family of 4.  In the end we were starving yet I had just spent $60 for a pizza and pasta dinner.  $60 spent at a Pizza restaurant should have you stuffed and with leftovers.  The restaurant is very small.  You will be shoulder to shoulder with other people.  The decor is nice.  It took a while for the order to be taken.  We ordered a salad, a small pizza and a full portion of pasta.  Everything actually tasted fine.  But the small pizza is only 4 slices and the full portion of pasta is a very small portion of pasta.  My two little daughters finished the pasta but was still starving.  Definitely go for the large pizza size.  Small Pizza here is more like a personal size and nothing is really large enough to share.  The quality is there but the value is not.",3.0,0
Good pie but the sourdough is kind of chewy/gummy because it does not rise very well. Amazing salads and good selection of craft beer. We will go back again,4.0,1
Always GREAT !!! Phoebes salad - small ... still big enough for 4 ... pizza different with sourdough crust - but nice!!! The vibe is great - we live 2 hours away but try to stop when in area ... one of our favs in Berkshires,5.0,1
"I mean, this is good pizza. Not life changing, but definitely worth a swing in! The salad portions are gar-freaking-ganta-normous. They offer lactose-free mozzarella (always appreciated) and gluten-free dough, if that's your bag. The pizza combos are interesting and tantalizing;  some are even quite delicious! (Full disclosure - I didn't love the bbq chicken, but the queen margarita special loaded up with meats was pretty darned terrific.)If you like thin-crust pizza, you'll dig Baba Louie's. I mean, it isn't the equal of pizza you'll get from a wood-fired monster Italian pizza oven that sears stuff off at 9000 degrees...but it's good. Go.",4.0,1

"No, No, NO!  This place is TERRIBLE!  We walked in on a Sunday afternoon.  It was slow, we were seated right away.  We waited for 8-10 minutes, (really) and nobody came over to our table   We moved to the bar and the bartender felt heavily medicated.  She was a total zombie.  Her service was Slooooow but at least it was something.  We got the antipasti salad.  HORRIBLE!!!  I say that because the dressing was flavorless.  How can you manage to make a vinaigrette dressing flavorless, all oil no spices..  We both ordered pizzas and had one slice of the Dirty Burrito pizza and two slices of the BBQ Chicken pizza.  The dough was again, flavorless and truly tasted like cardboard.  We could not believe for such a highly rated place how bad this experience was between the service and the food. We felt bad so we took the pizza to go as we had two pretty much full pizzas and I didn't want to waste food. When we got near the car we threw it in the garbage (true story) walked away $60 lighter and completely dumbfounded as to how this place has some sort of Zagat rating.",5.0,1
BL is great.  Yummy pizza that is not full of grease and instead full of fresh fresh ingrediants.   The salads are THE BEST.  They are one of my favorite pizza places ever. This is not NY style pizza.  It is more california style sourdough wood fired oven pizza. Super fresh and yummy.  It is owned by a great guy who is nice to his employees too.  So you can feel great supporting this place.  During Covid - he took many precautions to keep his employees safe and for now is only doing TO GO.  But he is killing it! We are all lucky to have BL in town.,2.0,0
"I'm normally someone who ignores reviews that complain about bad service (im there for the food) but this was some of the worst service I've experienced in a restaurant.tl;drServer was unfriendly and unhelpful. Split the check weird. Charged mandatory 20%gratuity for a party of 4 (despite terrible service). Pizza was great - margherita especially.Our hostess sat us at a table where we sat for about 10 minutes before our waitress approached us (the restaurant was not busy - there were two tables occupied including ours). One of our party is pregnant and explained to the waitress that she can't have unpasteurized cheeses and asked whether the feta cheese was pasteurized. The waitress responded ""probably"". No knowledge and no offer to find out. That's fine we'll take it on the side. An hour later our food arrived (we assumed that pizza would be a relatively quick stop). In contrast to the service, the pizza was quite good. We got a large margherita and pizzerella Isabella and a small Greek salad. The quantity was good and the margherita pizza was excellent.We attempted to flag down the waitress to ask for more water and were repeatedly ignored even after making eye contact. At this point we've eaten and are ready to leave. We're finally able to ask for the check only because the waitress stops at the table next to us to take their order. We put two credit cards in the check assuming she would split it 50/50. Instead when the check comes back she has charged one of us $2 and the other $52. To make matters worse, she charged an automatic 20% gratuity even though it clearly states that gratuity is charged for parties of 8+ (we were 4).At this point we've spent 2 hours at the restaurant and are ready to leave so we don't worry about dealing with it (not that we could find anyone to mention it to). Overall, the food was good but it was not an experience any of us would like to repeat.",5.0,1

"What a nice find.!! Who knew that most of the restaurants in Great Barrington are closed on Tuesday? Hungry and frustrated, we stumbled upon this little pizza place and we're not expecting much. We loved it the minute we sat down - great vibe -rustic and sultry. The waitress was a doll, the Sangiovese nice and dry, and the salad and pizza delicious. You can imagine our surprise a week later when Dustin Hoffman mentioned it in his latest film with Adam Sandler stating ""Baba Louie's ...  the best pizza joint in the Berkshires.""",3.5,1

"Got takeout pizza from this place and it was gooooood. Not my favorite kind of crust but delicious pizza, and the combo of flavors was great.

"Super delicious pizza. Crust was perfect - thin, some crispiness. Flavorful sauce and cheeses. Very good service. Only downside is no reservations - which I knew in advance. They were accurate on the waiting time for a table. They also text you when the table is ready so you don't need to wait around the restaurant.",5.0,1
"If thin crust pizza is your thing then baba louie's isna must try. There new location is much better then the old spot, more room and an actual bar to sit at. The crust is near perfect!! They have some really unique special pies as well. Tried the hannah joe last night which has fresh mozzarella, ricotta, red onions, shrimp, pineapple, canadian bacon and green chili sauce topped with dried coconut. The layers of flavor from this pie are delightful! Cannot wait to go back. Was also a fan of there sauce on the other pie that i tried. They also have a decant taplist and have some vermont goodies such as fiddlehead ipa and second fiddle, im sure its rotating and not there all the time but was glad it was while there.",5.0,1
You'll love their new location on Railroad Street- it has at least 3 times the tables of the old place so you can actually get one!You can't beat the pizza here and I've discovered a new favorite called Cole's Creation.  Fresh arugula and a vinaigrette on a pizza sound weird?Think again!,5.0,1

Such such good pizza!!!! The one w sweet potato had me craving for it and we even went in this cold to dine. Their portion is just right bc i dont eat much. But i do enjoy their food. The hawaiian pizza was also good (not called hawaiian). And also the one w prosciutto and fig (my fav),5.0,1
"Always a pleasure to come to Baba Louie's! I've been coming here with my family for many years and it's great to see their new location. I'm not going to decrease my rating because of the wait time/service, mainly because I know opening a new location can be extremely difficult and it's tough to find that routine they once had at the old location. That being said, it did take us awhile to be served and the manager actually took our order himself which was very kind. The dawns delight salad was excellent as was the dolce vita pizza (we subbed prosciutto for garlic sausage and I'd do it again). Also, the bartender is hands down the nicest man alive. Super lovely and charismatic! Can't wait to see how this new location develops.",5.0,1
"I stop in for lunch here everytime i am in Town.  I have never been disappointed and always got something fast and hot.  Typically i haven't really seen anyone else here for lunch so not sure how busy they usually are.  Specials are always good, salad, soup, pizza or pasta dish.  Ingredients and combinations sound very original and are, we thought up and sound and taste amazing.  Sometimes they have over done it on the garlic for the pasta dishes but for the most part they are right on point.  Seems like the perfect place for this area.",4.0,1
"We travel over an hour from home just to come here! We dine in pretty regularly. The gluten free crust is SO GOOD! (And you can purchase the crust to take and bake at home!)

Tonight we tried the gluten free carrot cake for the first time and no surprise, it was also awesome! Some of the servers, in the past haven't been super outgoing but the service supplied for the dining experience was always sufficient and done correctly. Tonight our server was so friendly and so patient! (I'm a very indecisive person so I take FOREVER to choose which pizza to get) If the food wasn't so great I would go back just for the hospitable service she supplied! Ask for her if you decide to dine- her name is Danielle, she went above and beyond for us.",5.0,1
"This is not the place to come if you're in a hurry (which applies to most restaurants in Hudson, NY) but if you're looking for a delicious pizza, then this is the place for you.

Probably one of the easiest, yet most delicious meals we had in Hudson.",5.0,1
"My partner and I went to Baba Louie's because it was recommended to us by some friends who know the area. I was pleased to find out that it was the number one place on Yelp!  Overall, it is a fine establishment, but I would stick to pizzas even though there were other offerings.This is a very small restaurant, so there would probably be a wait. They don't take reservations, and we showed up at around 530PM on a Saturday night. We were given a wait time of about 45 minutes. When that happened, we just walked around and got some coffee and did some window shopping. No big thing.We were seated and our friends had to go soon, so they both ordered salads. From being seated to getting the Greek salad was approximately six minutes, so I definitely give Baba Louie's credit for fast service. I ordered the cardinale pizza, and you pizzas are the way to go here. They're known for their sourdough crust, and was very nice. This particular pizza had fig, mozzarella, and prosciutto. My partner had one of their specials, chicken and linguine chicken broth. It was fine, but nothing special.Overall, Baba Louie's is a quaint, fun restaurant in Great Barrington. It's good for pizza, but considering how good the reviews were here, I expected somewhat more memorable pizza.",4.0,1

I introduced my husband and parents to this restaurant a few months ago (and the guys in the group are very picky/opinionated when it comes to food and new places) and they haven't stopped asking when we're going back!

"This restaurant lived up to all the great reviews. Growing up in Brooklyn and living in NJ, we know the best pizza. Well, Baba Louie's ranks with the best. The pizza is a thin crust be cooked to perfection. The wonderful flavor and quality sauce stimulates the taste buds. The sourdough is terrific. This is a MUST VISIT if you are in the Berkshires. FYI, the salads are excellent and huge!!  The service was so friendly and delightful. Might be worth a day trip from New Jersey!!",5.0,1

Whether you take out or eat in here, you won't be disappointed.The pizza is the best I've had in the US and equivalent if not better than some I've had in Italy.

Probably the best salad I have ever had in a restaurant.It's a great family place, or a date place.",5.0,1
"We ordered from this restaurant a few days ago and everything was delicious. They have lots of interesting toppings for pizza, so if you are feeling like something new this is a good place.

I've eaten at this location and their Pittsfield location several times. But when you add the pesto... WOW! It makes this pizza a knock out, especially for all the gluten-free vegans out there who have given up on ever getting to eat pizza again.And if you do try it, let me know!",5.0,1

We ordered the food at the take out window on the side of the restaurant (separate entrance) and the guy working there was helpful in figuring out how much food we need to order. it was a 15 minutes wait time, so went next door to get coffee. Food was nicely packed with utensils, plates, napkins. Pizza were okay. I had expected a lot from the Dolce Vita but the dried figs was a bit too crunchy. Flavor combination was good though - liked the spinach & prosciutto combo. I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce so I only had a small piece of the chicken, but the girls who did have the pizza didn't like the almost raw red onions on it. Had ordered a turkey panini separately.

I didn't taste any sourdough but the pizza was still good.(I love sourdough but the only true sourdough I've had in my life was in California. I'm very leery of any place in the Northeast that claims they use sourdough).My salad was disappointing. The lettuce was nice and fresh but the dressing had zero flavor. I thought maybe there wasn't enough dressing on my salad. I asked for an additional side of dressing but still it was flavorless.I'm taking off a star for the salad.,4.0,1

On one side I ordered the barbq chx one. Was delicious. But then i made my own. I asked for ricotta, goat cheese, caramelized onion and roasted vegetables. I got red sauce(didn't Ask fit that, maybe two onions, no goat cheese and no veges. It was a bit disappointing. My husband ate it. My sons pizza had mostly sauce on it with very little topping.

"We made a special trip to get the 'za here (well, combined it with another special trip, but close enough) and it was well worth the effort. Given how much I hate navigating Great Barrington during summer weekends, saying it was worth a special trip is fairly high praise.The inside seating is sparse, and waits run 45 minutes to an hour on weekends in season. Plan accordingly.We ended up using the takeout window, on the inside of the arcade. There's no place to sit while you're waiting, but they're prompt (less than 20 minutes for two pizzas and a sandwich).The eggplant and smoked gouda was utterly fantastic, and the portabello with pesto was nearly as good. There are more detailed and effusive descriptions of the pizza in other reviews, but I will simply again note it's worth a special side trip. Among the best gourmet pseudo-flatbread pizza I've ever had. Only points off here are for the cramped facilities and somewhat less than bargain prices (and the generally nightmarish parking during peak hours).",4.0,1
"We made a large (very large!) order with Baba Louie's for our pizza party rehearsal dinner. Cara handled our order and was easy to work with and helped me decide on how many pizzas/salads to get. Her pizza predictions were on point! We had some leftovers, which all got eaten by the end of the wedding weekend. Plus, the pizza is so delicious. Amazing crust, delicious marinara sauce and yummy specialty toppings (try the turkey sausage!). I would also really recommend their Caesar salad. We had quite a few folks with dietary restrictions, and Baba Louie's did a great job accommodating everybody. Thanks again!",2.0,0
"Overall, this is a great little pizza place!My friends and I stopped in for lunch, and between us we tried a salad, panini, pasta, and pizzas. All of them were delicious, but a little inconsistent (the panini didn't have the cheese on it, they were out of bacon, etc.).",5.0,1
"I'm not sure how this place received 4.5 stars. The food is good, which is the only reason why i'm giving the place 2 stars instead of one.  The waitstaff was extremely slow for a place that looks as if the diner turnover is quick (especially since there's usually lines of people waiting to get in). We expected fast service seeing how there were lots of families with toddlers and young kids. Unfortunately our waiter took an order for a large group and then disappeared for around 15-20 minutes. Luckily the place was very loud so the other customers couldn't hear very well our hungry and impatient 18-month old whining and crying while we were waiting for someone to just take our order. I had to ask the hostess twice about where our waiter was after seeing the waitress on the otherside of the restaurant taking orders from guests who were seated long after us...When our waiter finally came around, he was nice and apologized for the wait but it took another 15 minutes to get the food after we ordered. Yes, it was good, but not worth the wait especially since it was not easy appeasing a hungry crying toddler for an exceedingly longer than expected length of time. If you don't have a tot, this is probably a great place or if you don't mind waiting a long wait just for pizza.",5.0,1
"Incredible. Mushroom soup was as good as I've had at fine dining restaurants. Same for the ""build your own"" salad with lemon herb dressing.

Great crust and toppings, good price again; only thing I could fault them a bit for was the sauce was too sweet. Service was okay for how packed it was. Just a great place to end up for dinner after shopping!",3.5,1

"I've heard Baba Louie's underwriting messages on public radio for years and years and finally checked it out this weekend. We had just finished a ropes course in Egremont and were HUNGRY. Our salad and 2 pizzas were incredible- place was well decorated and comfortable so glad we stopped, will definitely do it again next time we're in the area.",5.0,1
GREAT GLUTEN FREE PIZZA!! I was so glad to find a restaurant in the Berkshires that offered very good gluten-free pizza!! I ordered the Abbondante BBQ Chicken pizza. The pizza was fresh and full of flavor. I will definitely visit Baba Louie's the next time I am in the Berkshires.,5.0,1

"Ok so I wasn't really in the mood for pizza, but we were so hungry we bit the bullet and went in. It was pretty quick service which was great. You can easily split a salad with someone and a pizza.  The pizza...you can pick a couple kinds of crust like regular, spelt and gluten free. I think we just had the regular crust with sauce, pesto, cheese and sausage. The pizza was delicious!",4.0,1
"VERY tiny restaurant. My sister and I went on a Sunday night and stand outside while we waited. Then plus side, the pizzas cook quickly so tables clear quicker. My sister and I were in the restaurant only about 30 minutes from start to finish. I got the classic cheese and it was really good. My sister got 2 other kinds of pizza. She likes all the different toppings. She loved it. The food was great but I'm not sure if I'd go back to this location due to the size. It's just too small.",5.0,1

"Visited this past weekend with a group of friends.  This place was recommended by several people as a must eat place.  We were not disappointed.  We were a group of seven and we were seated within 20 minutes.  For our group, we ordered 3 pizzas and a salad.  The Melanzana Cardinale was delicious and had us fighting over the last slice.  Dolce vita and Cole's Creation were also very good.  Had the house salad also.  It was just mixed greens, but they were very fresh.  If ordering, make sure to get both dressings and mix them together.    This was plenty of food for the seven of us.  With wine included, we each paid $17.  A very reasonable dinner for the amount of food we ate.  If I am ever in the area again I will definitely be back.",5.0,1

"Excellent pizza.  We ordered the dolce vita to go.  The crust was very good, had the right crunch to it.   The toppings tasted very good especially the fig.   All in all I would certainly eat here again but only to go since the restaurant seems small and there's always a wait.  Keep in mind the pickup window has a line too so factor in the wait time there when ordering.",5.0,1

"Whenever I try a new pizza restaurant I make a point to order a plain Cheese pizza. You can really tell about the quality and taste when it's not hidden under toppings. They have a lot of interesting pizza combos that we didn't dare try, but might be if interest to those who are daring. We also enjoyed a Caesar salad with our pizza. The crust is thin and being sourdough a little chewy but the Taste was on point. definitely not your traditional pizza experience. Worth a try if you haven't been yet. We ordered take out from the small little window in the hallway.",5.0,1
"This is our SECOND visit to Baba Louie's but our first visit to this location in Great Barrington, MA.  Our first trip was to their location in Hudson, NY in 2010 and that was such a great experience we wrote a YELP! praising them then.This trip was just as good as our first one!!  YUM!!!   spelt pizza crust w/ mozzarella, red onion, ripe tomatoes, garlic, arugula lettuce and balsamic dressing on top...the Cole's Creation!  YUMMMMMMMY!!  My partner ordered the Puttanesca pizza (oh...they created a 1/2 and 1/2 large pizza for us!  that is unusual and very nice) and he LOVED it.Our waitress was very nice and accommodating.  The atmosphere was lovely and we ate at 9 p.m. during the week so it was a bit quiet, but we were happy to have the place a bit peaceful for us.  They need some serious attention to having more micro-brew beers (local ones) available.  Really, what goes better w/ pizza then beer??    Now...if these folks would JUST open their lovely chain restaurant in Oakland, CA we would eat there every week!  : )YUMMMY!!",5.0,1
Because we live just across the border in Connecticut we are lucky enough to be in great Barrington more than most of our friends. My fiancé brought me here and what can you say probably the best pizza ever. It's definitely worth a stop,5.0,1

Don't let the large number of positive reviews skew the truth.  This place is a hack job.  i travel into town five times a year and choose a new place each time.  I'm usually pleased with local results (Naji's for instance). I ordered three items to go back to my room and all three were messed up. On a cold wintery night at 8 PM when you'd think no issues would ensue and the place was empty except for one table.  Soup-lukewarm and tasteless Salad-wrong order.  The dressing was correct.Pizza-flavorless Hawaiian version.  Three chunks of pineapple on the small pizza was weak.  No need to return here with so many better local options.  And the staff could use a lesson in simple politeness.  They had dour looks on their faces as if the take out order was a burden.,5.0,1
"Best pizza place in the Berkshires! I was always disappointed with the limited variety and quality of restaurants in Great Barrington. There are few good spots, and Baba Louie's is at the top of the list!This pizzeria is very small, maybe 10-15 tables? The wait is long (around 30 mins) and the interior is a bit dated. However, after tasting the pizza everything else becomes irrelevant. I love the variety of pizzas, each offering deep and contrasting flavors. Salty and spicy toppings with sweet tomato sauce, yum! The first time I went, I ordered the Melanzana Cardinale (Fresh mozzarella, eggplant, tomatoes, smoked gouda and pesto, garnished with parmesan and red pepper flakes) which was so good, I ordered the Pomodoro Bianco (fresh mozzarella, roasted portabellas, roasted garlic, tomatoes, red onions, chêvre, pesto and parmesan) right after!Great thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients and bold flavors - reminds me of pizza from Italy.",5.0,1

"GOD! Terrible for big groups! Had to wait OUTSIDE (it wasn't too cold, but I would have preferred waiting INSIDE in a SEAT). Finally got inside but our table wasn't even prepared yet. Was moved around many times before we were able to settle. We had one water jug for all 11 of us with only SIX cups for us all. It took 10 minutes to get enough glasses and utensils for us all, and we ended up with extras anyways. Moving on, we ordered 6 pizzas, and the wait began. We were PRESSURED into buying a salad for the table, which cost TWENTY dollars. Ridiculous! I had trouble finding the bathroom, but thank God the door had a piece of paper taped to it. Salad came quickly enough. The lights dimmed at two separate times while we waited, and I was one popcorn bag away from being ready to watch a movie.  We must have waited 45 minutes for our pizza, all while tables to our left and right got served all willy-nilly. My ice in my glass for my root beer had turned to WATER long before our pizza came. Our pizza finally came, but the pies arrived at scattered times; not even all at once!",5.0,1
"I visited Baby Louie's with my boyfriend while visiting Great Barrington. The place was packed and we had to wait about 30 minutes, but I'd say it was worth it! The restaurant was fairly small, so we had to wait outside, but the weather was perfect outside.We ordered a small BBQ Chicken pizza to split. We got a small because we were not very hungry. The pizza was very tasty and the crust was made with sourdough which was very unique, but good. It was a combination of BBQ sauce, chicken, red onions, fresh mozzarella, smoked gouda, oregano and parmesan. We loved the pizza so much that we ordered a small of the Riccardo's Pizza Famosa which was tomato sauce, chêvre, sun-dried tomatoes, asiago, kalamata olives, mozzarella, roasted garlic, basil and parmesan. Both were great pizza's and had wonderful flavor!If I make it back to the area, id stop by again. My boyfriend stayed in the area longer and he had already returned for another visit!",3.5,1
"I have such mixed feelings about baba louie's that make it difficult to review. I recognize it's ""objective"" superiority as a restaurant -- quality ingedients, friendly service, creative and interesting menu items, and they do an admirable job of making pizza that can meet every sort of dietary restriction that these wacky granola - munching Berkshireites could dream up. I just don't like it very much... While trying all their quirky pizzas was fun at first, they gradually wore out their welcome with my palette.  Theirs always at least one thing I don't like -- The figs on the prosciutto and fig pizza, the sauce on the barbecue pizza, and the salad pizza... well let's just say that anybody who can get excited about a salad pizza more than once probably has a pretty sad life.)Overall Baba Louie's is great for tourists and New Yorkers and to enjoy a fun taste of the Berkshires, but, for me at least, isn't necessarily a pizza you'd want to live with. It's pretty expensive, too.",3.0,0

"Did takeout here and called in ahead for what we assumed to be an easy pickup. With five people in line in front of us the pickup somehow took 40 minutes. By the time we reached the window to pickup one single pizza the girl first took our name, then returned with another woman's pizza because she had been waiting an hour and a half, had completely the wrong order, took the woman's order, answered several other call in orders (there were others dedicated to answering the phone as well), then finally went to get our pizza and STILL had the wrong stuff. Management needs to come up with a good system if they ever want to have their business meet the demands- every step of the way was discombobulated.

"We stopped by around 1:30 PM on a Saturday and had to wait about 30 minutes to get a table of four; it's not a huge place, hence the wait even that late in the day. We ordered a small Dolce Vita pizza and a large pizza split between Melanzana Cardinale and Pomodoro Bianco, which was just the perfect amount of food to share between three reasonably hungry pizza but to not be overstuffed. The pizza itself was fairly well made--the sourdough crust held up very well, wasn't too thick, and managed to keep all the ingredients on top of it. The ingredients were all fresh and went reasonably well together, and although the service was a bit slow, I'd come back for a bite with small groups if in the area.",4.0,1

"This artisan pizza is F-ing excellent. Wood fired, real sourdough, and high quality toppings. And interesting things like figs. The Dolce Vita is stellar.

"Holy amaze balls, this place is incredible! After reading a couple of my Yelp friend's reviews, I knew I would find an excuse to check this place out ASAP. Well as luck would have it I found I guy on CL that was a few minutes away from here that was selling wavy glass (glass from old windows), so we were able to give this place a shot. My wife and I were ravenous when we arrived around 6:15pm on a Friday. Judging from its popularity and the people on the streets I was resolved to eating the less important fingers on my left hand while we waited. Fortunately my hand is still fully intact since we were seated right away. Jessica and I shared the 10""  Dolce Vita and the Melanzana Cardinale. Our food arrived in ~18 minutes (I time my food, yes I'm that guy). Both were divine, the Vita for me nailed the salty sweet flavor perfectly with the saltiness from the prosciutto and the sweetness from the figs. Fan flippin tastic!!! (I'm having a hard time forming coherent sentences) The Cardinale was equally awesome, I was just a little more impressed with the Vita.Alot of times I'm let down at places like this because I over-hype them in my mind, making it an insurmountable task for most places to overcome. Not the case with Baba Louie's, the service was quick and efficient, and the food was perfect. Yes you are paying more for a pizza than the countless pizza parlors that pepper the landscape like churches in the South; but I would rather be blown away by a pizza with amazingly fresh ingredients than experience the same forgettable experience, burdened with half a pizza to either freeze or eat for the next 2 days for a total of 4 meals. If you're reading this, stop reading get in your car and eat some damn pizza (ok I will allow you to plan a half-baked adventure that puts you within 30 min of this place).",4.0,1

"Definitely one of the best pizza places on my list now however it's a bit far. This town is wonderful as well. Located among the mountains and great scenic view, I will love to come here every fall. Anyway back to the pizza. The ingredients are fresh and you can taste every bit of the sauce to the cheese. The crust is crispy and delicious. There's no better way to describe than to actually taste it. Do go.We got here luckily before the dinner rush and the guy behind us had a 30 minute wait and we got 5 minutes. There's no space for greater than 6 people and I suggest you come with 2 to 4 people. We had 2 large pies and large salad and that is enough to call a day after a long day of hiking.",5.0,1
"Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch good pizza. Wow. Like. I can't EVEN. Got one with figs I think, and prosciutto? It was a while ago but boy was it insanely awesome. I was with a party of six, so we got two pizzas two split which means two pieces per person... Or so I thought. 8 x 2 = 16 hmmm there is no 'divided by' symbol on my laptop. Am I dumb? It was painful, getting to the end of my second slice, wanting that third. TURNS OUT there was enough for some of us - all of us? To eat THREE. I AM SO DUMB. I totally could have eaten MORE than three because this pizza is so good. Basically I'm not even helping out here in this review because I'm not using my words to effectively describe why this pizza is so divine. It is so divine. Thin crust, fresh ingredients - I GAG at my choice of descriptors. Talking about food sucks. But this pizza.... This pizza here: it does not suck.",5.0,1

"Very good pizza!  Just passing through town and stopped to get a bite. Quaint little village to walk around on a pretty fall day in early October.And a small, but good selection of draft beers. A little disappointed about substituting toppings, though. One pizza sounded great, except we didn't want olives or the certain cheese it came with. They couldn't sub broccoli or tomatoes for olives and they had to keep that cheese. Turned it out to be really good, though.",3.0,0

"So right when you walk in, you'll notice this place is small but the space is used in such an efficient way. The drapes that keep the cold outside is such a good idea and even when I'm near the door I'm nice and warm. Anyways, onto the food. This place puts out such a damn good salad, soup and pizza. All of them are so good and well priced (if that's a big concern to you). They also have the to-go area away from the front restaurant which I'd have to imagine keeps the flow of people in and out of the door to a much lesser amount. That is great intuition. I've not had a crazy awesome server but on that note they've all been good and gotten my order correct. I'm not huge on the crazy butter-me-up service anyways so I like it the way it is. Try this place, you'll be stoked that you did!",5.0,1

"I have NEVER met a person who has hated this place. If I ever do, I might keel over and die merely from the shock!Pizza does not get much better than this. The grains for the dough as all freshly ground locally without any preservatives. All of the vegetables are fresh, local, and (for the most part I would assume) organic. Oh, and the mozzarella! None of that ""pre-grated cheese from a plastic bag"" mess. This is fresh and fabulous. There are gluten-free options and vegan options, so it's perfect for those with dietary restrictions and / or preferences.My three favorite pizzas are the basic Queen Margherita, the Melanzana Cardinale, and the Dirty Brutto. They are delicious AND beautiful, with the Melanzana Cardinale boasting a lovely green swirl of pesto sauce. Side it with a Dawn's Delight Salad, and you are in HEAVEN.Sometimes the wait for a table is long, but it's one of the few places where I would wait 45 minutes to get a table.",3.5,1
"Anybody claiming they aren't served because of their skin color is pathetic and asking for undue sympathy. I used to regular this place for both dine in and takeout and love the staff here. It isn't their fault that tourists decide locals are plebeian and treat everybody with disrespect. The reason I don't go all the time anymore? I moved. Here's the deal: if you go on a busy night, you wait. Get used to it. Oh, and if you didn't notice, I'm not white thanks.",4.5,1

"Oh there's a reason that this tiny little pizza place in a tiny little town in Western Mass has received so much attention... these guys really know what they're doing. Despite all initial skepticism about its questionable location and quirky namesake, I found Baba Louie's to be an ideal pizza experience.The menu is simple, but that's a good thing, because you don't want to come for anything other than a salad and a pizza. We went with the Dawn's Delight salad, and La Dolce Vita pizza.Both were just awesome. the salad was well portioned and beautifully presented. And the pizza... It's genuinely artisan, made with a sourdough crust and unique toppings. I mean, figs and rosemary oil, really?.This is also the type of place that does gluten-free, yeast free, and vegan, making it a great place for expensive German car drivers who take up silly causes with their overabundance of free time.But I don't bother with that unadulterated nonsense. Normal people will enjoy Baba Louie's just as much.",3.5,1
"I actually came here during that freak blizzard in OCT. of 2011. I came here based on all the rave reviews of this place on yelp and I must say that I was not disappointed. I ordered the dolce vita pizza and the Boyfriend ordered something which I can't remember at this time. I thought the pizza was delicious. This isn't your typical NY style pizza with the thin crust, the pizza's here lean more towards the gourmet side. Even my boyfriend who is a self professed pizza snob was impressed.  The pizza dough is gluten free so if you have celiac's or a sensitivity, and tired of cardboard with tomato sauce slathered on top and want to enjoy a real pizza, this is the place for you!I can't wait for my next trip up to Great Barrington so I can get another pizza!",4.0,1

It was really good, but people seem to be flipping out over the pizza.Diet Coke and Pepsi fiends will be disappointed -- Baba Louie's is one of those very rare restaurants that has declined to associate themselves with either Coke or Pepsi. They do offer Tommy's Naked Soda, a regional soda made with cane sugar and other natural ingredients.",4.0,1
"fun family place - small, noisy in a good way, friendly efficient service. Unfortunately the food is only ok. we shared a good fresh salad with dried fruit and nuts and had 3 pizzas. The sauce is delicious but the crust wasn't quite there, our 16yo said it was like fried dough. The gluten-free crust was unusually great at the edges without toppings but totally soggy (undercooked maybe?) beneath the topping. in the end it felt like it might have been an off night for them-i'd try it again.",4.0,1

"Every community should have a place like Baba Louie's. It's the first place that was recommended to us when we headed out that way and among the very top in terms of food. What makes it so great for diners like me is that they have gluten free and vegan offerings. No one questions you or looks at you with accusatory stares when you ask about gluten free or vegan. (Believe me, we are patronized at many places. It's a very unfriendly world out there when you don't eat meat or dairy.) The combination of ingredients, the crust and the wood fired ovens drew me, a person who rarely orders pizza, into a dreamy dining experience. It's so totally different from any other pizza I have ever had that it almost falls into another category altogether. Sweet potatoes, caramelized onions, figs, parsnips, tofu, artichoke hearts, roast garlic....along with traditional ingredients, these can be on your pizza, redefining your impression of a pizza joint. I also like the low key atmosphere and the efficiency of the take out. Last time we went, we ordered two custom pizzas, went across the street for a delicious martini and came back to pick up our pizzas hot from the oven. We devoured it all in front of a Red Sox game with some good wine and beer, and it was honestly one of the best meals I have ever had in the Berkshires. Do not miss Baba Louie's.",5.0,1
"On my way back to Albany from Mt. Washington State Forest, Baba Louie's was my restaurant of choice in the small town of Great Barrington.  Based on the solid reviews of their wood fired pizzas, I knew I was in good hands before I got there.  After a long day of hiking, the Dolce Vita pizza was not to be shared with anybody; all for me.  The California figs added a nice sweet flavor to the pizza while the prosciutto added a wonderful meaty/salty taste plus the spinach gave it some greenery to complete the diversity of ingredients.  Everything was cooked just perfectly and they didn't add too much fresh mozzarella or gorgonzola.  Just the right proportion of everything.And did I mention, sourdough pizza crusts!!!  Now that was a pleasant first for me.  Wood fire pizza, sourdough crust, and fresh ingredients..you can't go wrong.",5.0,1
"This review was based on one visit (June 2010).What I tried: Antipasti, Melanzana Cardinale pizza, Riccardo's Pizza Famosa, Insalata AllegraTasting Notes:  I cannot remember having pizza this good in a long long time.  It's not your typical NY style pizza (nor is it Chicago-style)... but whatever style it is or isn't clearly worked for me.  The crust looks more like flatbread, but it's definitely pizza dough, chewy without being overly ""bready."" But it's the freshness of the toppings (for ex., their fresh mozzerella is incredible), as well as the creative combinations of toppings that make this pizza joint so memorable.  If I go back to the Berkshires next year I will get the same pizza again: the Melanzana Cardinale.  The finishing touch on this pizza is the smoked gouda-- it blew my mind!  The antipasti is very fresh, light, and tasty (mix of roasted peppers, sundried tomatoes, proscuitto, spring mix, goat cheese, and delicious homemade mozzerella).I appreciate that they can make their crusts out of spelt on request (I have several friends who are celiac and I always feel bad that they can't have pizza). They also only carry natural sodas; in fact, their whole menu is in keeping with the crunchy atmosphere of the Berkshires.Ambience: Bustling and busy on the summer weekends (expect at least a 30min wait).  Good for large groups (though you might have to wait).Service: Very friendly and quick (once you get a seat).Recommendation: If you are vacationing in the Berkshires or just passing through-- this place is a must go.  It's bad enough that I have not found good pizza where I am living now, but having eaten at Baba Louies's just a few days ago makes the thought of the next few pizza-free months doubly sad.",1.0,0

Here's the bad news.  We've had our debit card and credit card COMPROMISED BY FRAUD not once, but TWICE in the past 2 years.  The first time was a debit card and our bank's fraud detection service cancelled the card within 30 mins of leaving the restaurant.  Then this summer (2016), my MasterCard was fraud alerted  a few days after. USE CASH !",3.0,0
"So glad you enjoyed your meal.  On the other matter, I have checked with our credit card processor as well as our systems IT staff and there has been no breach of security.  Please feel free to contact me and perhaps we can  help figure out what is going on here.  Thanks",3.5,1
"I really do not understand the 4 or 5 star reviews for Baba Louie`s.  The appropriate rating is 3 stars (which is still a pretty good rating).  Anyways, the dining room is fairly small with a left and right side divided by curtains.  The server that we had was a grumpy lady in her 40s, perhaps that grumpiness kicked away a star.As for the pizza, it is pretty tasty and there are several unique combo pies.  There are some toppings including shrimp, which you do not see too often at pizza joints.  So, in addition to the sourdough crust, there are aspects here which differentiate Baba Louie`s.  But in the end, when you are paying a pretty penny and dealing with a bad attitude from your waitress, there is no way you could rate this above 3 stars.  Perhaps next time, I will just get some pie from their take-out counter.",4.5,1
"I did not eat at the restaurant but I purchased the GF sourdough crust from a bakery in CT- still delicious in Westbrook. I was very impressed with the crust! I have been GF for 9 years now, and this has been my favorite by far! Taste is flavorful, and texture- with chew and crunch and not soggy at all. I do look forward to eating at the restaurant!",5.0,1
Our first night in Great Barrington and we decided this looked like a cute place. The staff was friendly (especially Danielle) and service was quick. My husband ordered pasta and I ordered a pizza and it was delicious ( 1/2 Cole's and  1/2 dolce vita). Would visit regularly if we lived in the area.,5.0,1
I don't like writing a negative review but the service was so bad and unfriendly that I couldn't let it go. The pizza was delicious but the experience was not pleasant. They need a strong boss to reel them in.,3.0,0
"We always stop by Baba Louie's at least a couple of times while in the area. Their pizzas are interesting and always delicious. We especially love the Dirty Brutto (roasted potatoes), the Isabella (roasted sweet potatoes, onions...) and the Dolce Vita (figs, prosciutto). The pizza has a very thin crust and is wood fired. If you're looking for more typical NY style pizza this is not the right place. We've ordered salads a few times as well and they were always delicious. Service is friendly and fairly quick. The place fills up quickly and there's often a wait. If you want to eat here on a busy night, put your name down first thing and then explore the candy shop next door. One thing to keep in mind, the restaurant closes for a few hours between lunch and dinner. I don't remember the exact times, but if you're heading out for a late lunch, check if they're open first.",5.0,1

We have enjoyed the pizza for years.This year we tried their wonderful (imaginative) portobello mushroom salad - true gourmet treat!The staff is warm and caring and the food and surrounds are perfect for a pizza night out.I am not a beer expert but my date enjoys their brews and their wine list is perfect for me.A must!Linda,5.0,1
"What can I say that hasn't been said?  Babe Louie's is easily one of the best pizzas you can get, and that goes beyond the borders of Great Barrington!  I work in NYC and sample a lot of pizza, and I must say this rivals some of the best in the city.For starters, I want to compliment the wait staff.  Fun, attentive, eager and willing to please.  We had many-a-demand, multiple bottle of wine, sauces, waters, supplements upon supplements to our original order... and they were so helpful, kind, and you could tell you enjoy serving your dinner.Now onto the food... we got a pizza with fresh basil, fresh mozzarella, and prosciutto.  If you're looking at the menu, you won't find those items on a specialty pizza together, but Baba Louie was more than happy to accommodate our custom request.  Others at the table ordered the penne a la vodka and a dinner salad.All of the food was spectacular, both in taste and quality.  The ""large"" pizza is what most places would call a medium, but one bite and you realize that it's still worth every penny.  It's not size that counts in fine dining, and this is the perfect example.The restaurant itself is small, not much elbow room in the split dining area, and there will likely be a wait.  But the wait is well worth it.  The decor isn't anything special, but it is welcoming and comfortable, once you've squeezed into your seat.  That aside, it's not enough to detract from Baba Louie's earning a five star rating.So that's it!  Give it a try, it's the best pizza and pasta around, and if that's what you want, then you will regret trying another option!",4.0,1
"Baba Louie's is a must-try for visitors to the Berkshires, so I insisted on taking my parents here for lunch today when they came out to see me.To start, we shared a small Phoebe's Greek salad.  Even though it's $9.50, the helping is generous enough to easily feed two or three people.  This is one of my very favorite menu items here; I love the feta cheese, Greek olives, and roasted pumpkin seeds that come mixed in.  The seeds really add a pleasant flavor and good crunch to this salad.  Mom, a first time Baba Louie's diner, enjoyed it immensely.For the main course, we shared a Pomodoro Bianco pizza, which comes with mozzarella, portabella mushrooms, garlic, tomatoes, red onions, chevre, pesto sauce, and parmesan.  It wasn't my first choice; that would be the Melanzana Cardinale, but unfortunately, the restaurant was out of eggplant.  We tried the Pomodoro at the suggestion of the server.  My mom is not a big pizza fan, but she was really impressed with this place.  She commented that the flat sourdough used for the crust was almost like a flatbread, not overly filling or doughy.  She also really liked how the cheese used to top the pizza was real mozzarella instead of run of the mill shredded cheese.  I've been to Baba Louie's several times, so I knew to expect all of this, but it really made a good impression on the 'rents.  The pizza here is very different from what you'll find anywhere else.Usually Baba Louie's is packed, especially at dinnertime, but we came for lunch right around 11:45, shortly after it opens.  There were only one or two other parties, so we didn't have to wait around for a table (which is what usually happens when I come here).    Good to know!",4.0,1
"Just went here for the first time last weekend while visiting family in Great Barrington. We ordered the soup of the day (which is always vegan and that is cool), and it was a spicy corn chowder. The soup was pretty good and the bread that came with the soup was exceptional. Then we ordered a family style house salad with kalamata olives and that was also a great choice. I love that they offer family style salad. Then we ordered three pizzas: a large Baba Louie's Classic Cheese Pizza: Queen Margherita, small Melanzana Cardinale, and a small Abbondante BBQ Chicken Pizza. I can only speak for the Queen Margherita and the Melanzana. Both pizzas were delicious, but I would have ordered 3 Margheritas and probably eaten all of them myself. The crust was crispy (not burnt) and the sauce was something special. We dined at lunch, so we got seated right away, our server was extremely nice, and the food arrived hot and quickly. I will certainly return to Baba Louies.",5.0,1
"Babe Louie's is by far my favorite pizza.  Every time I am in the MA area, I have to make sure to stop by here.  Their ingredients are fresh, which makes a world of difference.   And I love the sour dough crust.  I wish more pizza places did this!I always do take out because the seating is limited and it always appears very busy when I go.  But the take out service is great and even has it's own side window so you can avoid the cluster of inside.  The only down side, there is no location in the Northern Virginia/DC area.",3.5,1
Pizza is amazing! We waited around 15 minutes for a table on a Friday evening which wasn't bad at all. The server was attentive and the pizza was drool worthy. We can't wait for the next time we can visit.,5.0,1
Thanks for the review.,4.0,1
The food was very tasty we had the antipasto salad with all the salads a single size is definitely enough for two people and maybe even three we thought we'd order another course if we were hungry but there was no way we could possibly do anything more after that service was a bit slow and the place wasn't even there but it was worth the food was delicious,5.0,1
"I finally went to Baba Louie's after hearing so much about it for years from family members.  On a long weekend vacation, my friends and I had dinner here and loved it.  We were able to order our own small pizza's and everything was wonderful.  The service was quick and it has a great atmosphere.I saw another review of the Isabella Pizzarella, and I would agree that it is wonderful!  I especially loved the sweet potato's combined with garlic.",4.0,1
"Really nice, crisp, flavorful sourdough pizza crust (although you can also order a Spelt crust if you'd like). Pizzas are cooked in a wood-fired pizza over and everything is organic and fresh! My husband had a tomato based pie with prosciutto, figs, mozzarella, Gorgonzola, wilted spinach and rosemary infused olive oil -- he absolutely loved it. I made my own pizza with an olive oil and mozzarella base, with roasted garlic, broccoli, chicken, red onions and artichoke hearts - to which I added red pepper flakes, salt, pepper and dried herbs and a bit of olive oil on top. I could have done without the chicken as it was dry/overcooked. And, there was too much mozzarella cheese, The crust was perfectly cooked. Despite the two items I didn't like, overall the pizza was very nice. The service was great even though they were very busy. Other yelpers seem confused about what type of pizza this is -- in my view it's very similar to the type of pizza I've eaten on the West Coast, from the thin, crispy, flavorful crust to the fresh and interesting/non-traditional ingredients. This kind of makes sense since they call their sourdough crust a ""San Francisco crust.""",5.0,1
"I graduated from Simon's Rock in 2008, but I still haven't found a BBQ Chicken pizza I like more than Baba Louie's. When I was in school, I remember the salads and just this pizza - delicious crust, lots of quality BBQ sauce, and the best ingredients. I honestly can't remember any other pizza, but I do remember the pear and Gorgonzola salad. As soon as I get a chance to fly to Great Barrington, you can bet I'll be going to Baba Louie's for that pizza.",5.0,1

"One of the busiest restaurants in Great Barrington, Mass we hardly have a chance to eat here without waiting on line.Today, we found an opening at 12pm and enjoyed a great lunch.

"Guess i'll throw my 5 star in with the others...Came here on a Tuesday with my gf during fall season.  Had to wait a good 35min even on a weekday.  However, the place is definitely worth it.  Their pizza is some of the best I have ever had.  They have a green salad with the option to add extra fixings like pizza toppings, which was fun.  We got lemon vinaigrette dressing and it was great.For pizza we got the Isabella and Hannah Jo.  We were unsure on the Hannah Jo because it sounded so unique (shrimp, pineapple, green chili sauce), but the server assured us it was great.  We were glad she did because it was definitely our favorite.  The Isabella was also good, but we were fighting over the last piece of Hannah Jo.  Wine list was decent and fair price, we got a half bottle of Chianti which went well with the pizzas.Overall great experience, with my one complaint being that they were out of dessert that night.",4.5,1
"Baba Louie's is a good restaurant. It has good salads, which they put on a sourdough crust and call it pizza.

In both Hudson (Mexican Radio) and Great Barrington (Gypsy Joynt, there are far better restaurants with no wait.

"In the middle of nowhere with a mission to relax and soak up the 4 day weekend, a simple and satisfying lunch was on the agenda.  Small and unassuming, Baba Louie's is located in the heart of Great Barrington.  I love pizza and have a very discerning taste.  I like thin crusts packed with flavor, a perfect blend of cheese and sauce and I hate soggy, greasy messes.  The sourdough crust at Baba Louie's is incredible, and absolutely rivals many of the ""must try"" pizza joints in New York City.We started with a Caesar salad which was so good.  There wasn't too much dressing, there was just enough Parmesan and the there was the just right amount of pepper to make it interesting.  A large family size salad fed the two of us perfectly.  Also try their China Cola to wash it down.  They don't serve Coke products at Baba Louie's and this is a great substitute.  After the salad we went traditional and had a large Queen Margarita pizza.  The crunchy crust is skillfully topped with homemade sauce and wonderful fresh Mozzarella.  I would highly recommend trying some of the more interesting pizzas as well.  Cole's Creation is one of my favorites -- topped with fresh arugula and feta cheese.  With the large salad and the large pizza, we had about 2 slices left at the end of our feeding frenzy.  It was the perfect amount of food and the remaining slices make for a great snack later on.  Who doesn't love cold pizza!?Final Analysis:This incredible specimen of a pizza, in this adorable hole-in-the-wall restaurant, perfectly located in this quaint Massachusetts town made for a fun, relaxing and delicious lunch.  If you're in the neighborhood try it out, enjoy a great fresh meal and then go next door to the candy store for a sweet treat!",5.0,1
"Let me first say that I live here, I'm not a tourist. My husband and I were meeting here for his dinner break before headed back to work.  We had an hour. We arrived and there surprisingly was no wait time, we were seated immediately. We typically avoid Baba Loiues for the wait times alone. We ordered our drinks and pizzas quickly. We had to remind our server of my husbands drink and the sweetener for my tea. We also had to ask for clean glasses for our water, they had lipstick stains on them. We were never offered refills on any of our drinks. It took over 40 mins to get our salad and at 55 mins passed the hour, tables that were seated after us had received their dinners and were finishing them before ours had even arrived. I stopped our server after she was serving a different table that was seated after us and told her to box up our pizzas to go. She asked why (with attitude), and I told her that we ordered almost an hour ago and my husbands dinner break was over. She questioned me and said ""really? An hour?!"" (Again with attitude). My husband walks out to get to his office and 15 minutes later she tosses the boxes of pizza on the table and throws (literally) the bill down with it. No eye contact, no apology, no thanks for coming in, nothing! The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the pizza is good, small and expensive, but good. We ordered 2 small (personal size) pizzas and 2 non-alcoholic drinks (oh and they don't serve fountain soda) and our bill was $50. We won't eat here again!",2.0,0

This is not your typically New York style, thin, cheese, Neopolitan pizza.  Might be the only place that makes pizza as good or better than my own.  Some who know me know I make a mean pizza with interesting toppings.  It's a small place so you may need to wait a while to get in after skiing Butternut or anytime.  Great salads too.  Get a pizza and a salad to share with 3-4 people and your good.  I've tried the one in Hudson but its not the same in my opinion.",5.0,1

The waitress was friendly and the atmosphere was chill, but then again it was a Monday night. The pizza crust itself has a nice sourdough flavor and they have BBC on tap, Steel Rail and Porter. What threw me off and always does is how clean the bathroom is. That tells me a lot about the restaurant as a whole. It was not clean. Not filthy, but not something I wanted to walk into. Sometimes the food is so good you can overlook other areas, but unfortunately just an A-OK for me.",2.0,0
"I travelled an hour to Great Barrington and wanted to try this restaurant and it was very disappointing. I ordered a sandwich and waited over 40 minutes in a not so busy restaurant. When I asked for my food they came back and said it was made wrong and they were redoing the sandwich. And it was wrong again. I just ate it. No one came by to check on me during all this time. Only after I told them that I had not received my food, they gave me some bread. Other customers came, ate and left by the time I received my sandwich. I also had a dirty glass, they took it away and did not replace until later when I mentioned I was still without a drinking glass. I am usually very forgiving in my reviews, but the staff and chef really seemed to not care about a customer sitting by herself and having lunch. More attention on their customers and the chef/servers communications needs to approve. I also noticed take out customers waiting and being irritated with the slowness of their orders.",5.0,1

"Stopped by for lunch on New Year's day 2013 at 2:30. Was really surprised to learn that the wait would be 30 minutes and if not seated by 3, then the restaurant would be closed for an afternoon break.  Luckily we got seated in time, just at 3.  This meant the waitress was really anxious to get us taken care of, so she could go on break.  this likely also was the cause for the confused order.  The pizza that came out was not what we wanted and wasn't something we really would have liked trying to eat.  To her credit, she put in a new order and in 5 minutes we had our expected Dolce Vita, which included fig, Gorgonzola, and spinach.  It was tasty but the crust, while well cooked (nicely charred) was lacking in flavor - it needed some salt and thyme.  The porter from the Berkshire brewing Company was a great accompaniment - flavorful, rich, and nicely hoppy.",4.0,1

"The pizza was delicious! It is on Berkshire Mountain Bakery crust, so that is an automatic win! The toppings were fresh and could be tasted independently and worked so well together as a whole. The Caesar salad was also very well done, and the small served four women as an app. The tomato sauce was one of the freshest I have ever tasted, and I come from an Italian family! The hostess was a tad curt, but our waiter was nice. They did seem to want to move people in and out quickly, but I can't blame them, it is a small place and it gets busy. The food is worth it, if you want to have a nice long chat, get it to go!",4.0,1
"The food was okay but the servers were actually rude. They want your table so badly fo the next customers that the SECOND you stop eating they come by, ask if u want the check and as soon a second you get up they seat someone else before you can even get out the door. They literally push you out. They also leave the door open so all the cold air comes in. They have such a small space that it's unfair to people eating there and being started down to see how much food they have left on their plates.",1.0,0
Very disappointed....Eating here for over twenty years on trips to Berkshires. Salad was still delicious but regular pizza was very disappointing to 3 out of 4 people. It was over sauced and dough was soft and droopy. Our loving lunch stop is no more. Very sad.,3.0,0

"Very yummy! The pizzas are all a little complex (aka the ingredient list goes on and on). We didn't try any of the salads, but instead opted for ""making our own"" pizza. The crust is indeed very good.",5.0,1
"There is a reason why when I get pizza now I say... ""its not baba louies, but its good""   Baba Louie's is sooooooooo good.   My sis had me try it for the first time and I was apprehensive because she said words like gourmet and gluten free... she did not lead on to how delicious it was.  I mean she did... but the words couldnt do it justice....  BBQ chicken Pizza is ridic.   The one with a ton of garlic and greens on top of it is really good as well... The problem is the BBQ chicken one is soo good I cant seem to order anything besides that.  The service has always been stellar.. even though one time they did mistakenly give me the wrong pizza... quickly rectified and I was on my way.  With all of the other selections in town for pizza, I would go here first... and then my list drastically falls off after that.",4.0,1
"I went here and I loved it. I had an awesome experience. The service was great and everyone is nice. The only thing I was not happy with that the space, its too small for the amount of people they get.",5.0,1

I only wish we had one close to home that we could go to!",5.0,1

We had a weekend house in the Berkshires for many years and never visited Baba Louie's.  Were up visiting some friends his weekend and tried it for the first time after having read about it.  Was was i doing all those years when i could have been here every weekend.  Being a bit of a purist I always judge a pizza place by their margherita and it was excellent.  Great crust and just the right amount of sauce.  We also had two of the custom pues both of which were also great.  Don't miss the salads which were very fresh with all organic ingredients.  If in the Berkshires be sure and check this out.,4.5,1
"Very, very good pizza with an absolutely dynamite crust and super-fresh ingredients (the basil, mushrooms, etc were delicious).  The service and ambience of the place are a bit frazzled and harried (when we were there at lunch-time, several very loud tables of families, high school kids, and assorted skiers on a mid-day break made the place a little jumbled).  Still, if you there for the pizza, then you are in the right place.  Loved the San Francisco sourdough crust.",4.0,1

"Went here for lunch.  Generally love their pizza from the Hudson location.  Eat-in lunch in Great Barrington was horrific.  Caesar salad was gross and we waited an hour for sandwiches.

"If you are on a gluten-free diet, this is the place for you!  I explained to my waitress that I have Celiac Disease and she went above and beyond to ensure that my food was safely handled!  I've been twice before and loved the Dirty Brutto pizza, the Dawn's Delight Salad and the Caesar salad (I had the croutons before I knew I couldn't have gluten: terrific!). My partner and I shared a small (side note: a small feeds two hungry people amply) house salad with balsamic vinaigrette, and a gluten-free BBQ chicken pizza.  Full disclosure: the crust was just okay taste wise, but the texture was great and the toppings were DELICIOUS!  Plenty of fresh mozzarella and Gouda, chicken and red onion and BBQ sauce to satisfy us!  The prices, for how fresh the food is, are always more than fair.  A salad, a small pizza and two drinks never run us more than $30!  The service is impeccable, and they let you enjoy your meal rather than constantly pestering you or rushing you!  Can't wait to go back!",5.0,1
"First time here today and won't be our last!! The salads are very well prepared and big portions. The vegan pizza is a huge plus because we don't get that everywhere in NYC!

"Some of the best pizza I have ever eaten and that includes New York pizza. Their salads are excellent as well.Baba Louie's has consistently superior food and is reasonably inexpensive. Certainly worth a visit as it is a ""Best in the Berkshires"".",5.0,1
"I was skeptical. In my part of the country every little town has at least three small pizza places churning out greasy, cheese-laden pies for future cholesterol-lowering drug addicts. Why should yet another small pizza place making promises they are unlikely to keep (sourdough crust? Wood fire?) be any different? In my effort to more effectively lead a life without regret I spent five minutes talking myself into crossing Babalouie's threshold.What an important five minutes that turned out to be...My lunchtime companion and I shared two small pies: the Isabella Pizzarella (roasted sweet potatoes, roasted parsnips, caramelized onions, roasted garlic, fresh mozzarella and shaved fennel, drizzled with reduced balsamic vinegar and parmesan) and the Dolce Vita(tomato sauce, wilted spinach, fresh mozzarella, California figs, gorgonzola, prosciutto and parmesan topped with infused rosemary oil).""Isabella"" is a masterpiece. The layered toppings sit as individuals on top of the chewy crust, but come together in flavor and texture with each bite. Thinly sliced, the sweet potato and parsnip yield easily to each bite, and the gentle dosing of cheese complements the starches well. The fennel helps keep the caramelized onion in check, and the sparing use of balsamic drizzle never becomes cloying.The Dolce Vita is almost as stunning. The prosciutto and tomato sauce seem a little out of place, but cannot detract from the one-two punch of figs and gorgonzola. The sauce is tangy and ladled on with a light hand. The prosciutto sits on top and can be easily removed if it is not your thing.Right, the crust: Our friendly waiter assured me it was genuine sourdough, leavened only by the yeasty critters they culture right there. Spot on deliciousness. Under the toppings I don't think I could have discerned if any commercial yeast made its way into the dough, but I didn't care. It was delicious.This is how I make pizza at home. A naturally leavened sourdough crust, wood-fired, with exceptional toppings. OK, I haven't yet built the wood burning pizza oven, but as a wise man once said, ""two out of three ain't bad."" Neither is five out of five.",5.0,1
"I was blown away by their pizza.  I ordered the Melanzana Cardinale small pizza, EXQUISITE, the pesto sauce on the pizza gave the pizza an amazing flavor.  I would recommended highly.   I also tried the Dolce Vita pizza,  oh I can't even describe how good it was the combination of the California figs and the prosciutto, especially because I like the combination of sweet and salt in my food.  Overall, I had an excellent experience, definitely  will come back when I am on the area.  The place is small, so I expect a wait.",5.0,1

"Great to have vegan pizza choices. The pizza is good, but not especially creative. My favorite remains Pizza Luce in the Twin Cities. Maybe I will have to go on a quest for the best vegan pizza?

The pizzas we have had in Great Barrington have not been quite as good, nor were they the same quality each time.",4.0,1
"Great Pizza and great Salads. I always get the Greek Salad, the feta is much more soft than your usually feta, I believe if is goat feta. The food is always consistent. This is a busy place, so service is very straight to the point. The reason why I only gave four stars is because of the lack of room, which really isn't there fault, but it is quite cramped. I do love this place though and would highly recommend.",4.0,1
"We really enjoyed the thin crust pizza, perfect crisp. We got a family size salad which was quite large. Could serve 6 people.

"I grew up in Great Barrington but now live in PA - suffice to say that every time I'm back home, I make it a point to eat pizza at Babalouie's. I have spent the last 8 years living in Italy, eating the real stuff, and I can tell you that Babalouie's knows what they are doing when it comes to pizza. They are unfailingly delicious, offering creative toppings along with a great wine list and local beers on tap.",3.5,1
"I've been coming to this place for the past decade when we camp in south county. To beat the wait, head there at about 4:45 so you can be seated when it opens for dinner, without the wait. And if you do have to wait, it is well worth it. Plenty of shops where the kids can putter around until your table is ready. Family sized salads are guano emojis, and the balsamic dressing is fantastic. Good stuff!!",5.0,1
"Favorite pizza ever! Seriously, I like this better than the much hyped though deservedly so Roberta's in Brooklyn (and it's half the price!) gotta love the Berkshires. I've been eating here pretty much my whole life and it's a must visit every trip. Top 2 pizzas: dolce vita (fig, Gorgonzola, prosciutto) and pomodoro Bianco (portobellos, pesto, goat cheese, tomato, and red onions). Pro-tip: ask for them to put the prosciutto on before it gets cooked for crispy prosciutto (soooo good!) you can also get the dolce-vita vegetarian if you get it without the prosciutto (a favorite of my dad's). If you dine in, expect a wait (especially during the tourist season), so try putting your name down and walking around the lovely town until they give you a call. To all the people that complain about the service: This is a small town! You can't go to any rural town looking for impeccable service or you will probably be disappointed. This spot isn't cheap, but it's worth every penny of cheesy, chewy heaven in your mouth.",5.0,1

"This used to be my favorite pizza in the world.  I'm not joking when I say that I used to get crazy selfish when we ordered this pizza and then my co-diners would start eating faster than me, thereby getting more than their share.  It's expensive and considered a treat, so I'd actually get grumpy about it, especially with the BBQ chicken pizza (yes, I know that I should probably work on this character flaw). However, something has changed in the past six months or so.  I'm not exactly sure what it is.  The cheese seems rubbery and the crust is definitely not as delicious.  I think that it used to be organic, so maybe they've changed the pizza dough recipe.  I don't know, but now Babalouie's is just not ALL-THAT, albeit still good.I guess all things that are too-good-to-be-true must come to an end... though I still have hopes that they'll turn things around and bring the high-quality experience back.  I really miss the good ol' days.By the way, if you are ordering take-out, double-check that they've given you the right order.  Three times we've ordered from them and gotten home only to discover the wrong pizzas in the boxes.  Since parking is a nightmare in Great Barrington on weekends, it is a HUGE hassle, and they don't give you more than a ""sorry, Charlie"" when this happens.  The last time, though, we complained until we got a $20 gift card, but that didn't seem like enough considering the number of times that this had happened and the royal inconvenience that it was to drive back into town to deal with having been handed a plain Margherita pizza instead of the expensive pizza that we'd ordered and paid for.  Obviously, we have learned our lesson and look inside the box before driving away from GB.",3.0,0
Line up early or you will wait.  I learned my lesson last year and this time was on line 25 minutes before opening. Really good pizza with lots of interesting topping combinations. Salads are good and huge.  Prices are very fair.  Service is good and friendly.  The family will be happy there.  Good place to go with the kids after camp pickup.,4.0,1
"Best Gourmet Pizza on the Planet!I can't do without my NYC style slices, but as for gourmet brick oven pizza, this is the best hands down. I travel the country for business and there is no other place like Baba's. Ricardo's and a Dawn's Delight is our usual. They have BBC Beer on tap and a great wine selection. Laid back atmosphere and awesome waitstaff. I've never had bad food or service ever. Take out is great too, just make sure they don't dress your salad but put it on the side.",5.0,1

"Five stars for excellent, fresh salads and pizzas. Minus three stars for two of the rudest waitresses ever. When my pizza was brought to me with pepperoni instead of roasted peppers - after waiting 30 minutes for a table and 20 minutes to be served - I said this was not what I had ordered. The response was ""I didn't take you order. Don't shoot the messenger.""  The waitress came over and in a rather annoyed almost argumentative way, said that it was her fault for pushing the wrong button, and that she would bring what I ordered. No one ever said they were sorry.  A woman at the next table turned to me and said, ""How rude.""  To their credit they did deduct $5 from the bill. We looked for someone in charge to discuss he matter rather than posting here, but there was no one. Hopefully, they'll give the waitstaff a little training in how to be more customer oriented. The kitchen is terrific. Now if they can just fix the front of the house.  PS. The Virgil's diet root beer was awful. You're better off with water.",2.0,0
"Thin crust woodfire oven sourdough pizza that is absolutely out of this world! This is the finest pizza you can get. The array of toppings is amazing, always fresh, delicious, and well-prepared. The standard pizzas they offer are creative, and you can always build your own. And if you're not in the mood for pizza, they have wonderfully fresh, enormous salads, a pasta entree every night that's full of tasty vegetables and rich sauce, and a hearty vegetarian soup. Always ask if they have dessert when you get there, as you shouldn't go expecting it; sometimes you will be disappointed. However, if they have their tiramisu, don't even think of leaving without having some, as it is absolutely outstanding. Truly made from an authentic recipe, it is sweet and rich, and embellished just slightly with chocolate chunks. This dessert is not to be missed. They also hire some of the most personable waitstaff in town. My boyfriend and I eat here quite often, and usually have the same waitress who remembers us with much enthusiasm.",5.0,1
"We stumbled upon this place on the way home from a day of skiing, and have now been back for the third time. We had three different wait staff, two were amazing and one was okay. The sourdough pizza base and pizza sauce are delicious. My husband is a big pizza lover and he said it's one of the best he's ever had, so that's saying something. They have a good variety of gourmet specialty pizzas with really fresh toppings and so far each one has been a hit. Haven't tried anything else but the pizzas, because they are just that good! But all of the food looks good. I wish we had a Baba Loui's in Westchester!",5.0,1

"Delicious pizza.  The vegetazione pizza is hands-down the best vegan pizza I ever had (it's no problem for them to hold the goat cheese). The large was more than enough for two big eaters for dinner, and we had a piece left over!  The bruschetta salad was also simple and delicious.",5.0,1

"I love Baba Louie's so much that I had to bring my visiting boyfriend there to show him just how delicious and awesome it was. We didn't skimp either. We ordered a large pizza, appetizers and a bottle of wine. The quality of the pizza was good, but the service started out great and declined as we neared closer and closer to kitchen closing time. We spent a while eating and taking our time enjoying ourselves. But we in no way were there past ten which is when the kitchen closes. We left at ten of ten and at that point I had actually taken back money from the tip we were leaving. My boyfriend got up to go use the restroom and I was able to sit and hear voices around me. The waitress and staff were actually making fun of my boyfriend and my silly and wined and dinned conversation! I was blatantly listening so I felt that lowering the tip amount was a smart move. How disappointing it was! I have no desire to hurry back there. I think I will just have to be more open minded to good food/bad service for next time so that I don't have any expectations. *",3.0,0
"Big portions, good ingredients, friendly service, and very yummy pizza.  Their crust is made of sourdough and is thin and crispy, and the toppings include high quality ingredients such as prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, and pesto.

"""Unfailingly delicious""--this is how another reviewer here put it. That really does sum up Baba Louie's. I have enjoyed dozens, if not hundreds, of outstanding meals at Baba Louie's in Great Barrington and a few at their Hudson location as well. I am only just now getting around to reviewing them; probably because I don't want to have a longer wait for a table than I already do! You simply cannot go wrong here. They are incredibly, consistently delicious! As if their reliable deliciousness weren't enough, their prices are also very, very reasonable. A couple can eat very well for less than $25. One recent evening, I ate there with two other adults and two young boys (13 and 10). They got the toppings slightly wrong on the large pie we had ordered and brought us an additional small pie, at no charge, to compensate for their error. What sweethearts! We usually have a Queen Margherita pizza with assorted toppings and a Dawn's Delight salad (greens, walnuts, gorgonzola, pears, and dried cranberries--superb!). They also feature pasta specials of various kinds that I have enjoyed on occasion. The pizza crust is always perfectly crisp with supremely flavorful and fresh toppings, the salad fresh and delicious. I've never had a bad meal or any complaint at BL's, ever. They are just the best around and prove that killer pizza can be had outside of the 5 boroughs.Just go already!",5.0,1
"One of my favorite places to eat in the Berkshires and definitely the best pizza place in the area hands down. The place is really tiny so it tends to fill up quickly. The tables are quite close together so the noise level can get pretty loud during prime hours. The pizza here is more gourmet compared to typical New York style pizza. By that I mean that the crust is not as thin, and is made with sourdough and is gluten free. You will not find greasy pizza here, as the toppings are all fresh and inspired. I have been here several times and tried different pizzas, but my favorite is Riccardo's Pizza Famosa with tomato sauce, goat and asiago cheese, kalamata olives, sun-dried tomatos, roasted garlic, basil and parmesan. Yum! The salads are also quite good. A word of warning: this place fills up very quickly, especially during the summer months. The food however, is definitely worth the wait.",4.0,1

"Visited Baba Louis's in the summer of 2013 based on their Yelp rating and was not disappointed.  We are from Somona County, so are no strangers to good food.  My family (4 people) split two salads: Dawn's Delight and Allegra.  Both were fantastic combinations of flavors, very fresh, perfectly dressed, and huge portions (we had the regular size, not the family size). then we split a large pizza 1/2 Melanzana and 1/2 Dolce Vita.  The crust was wonderful and the toppings again were excellent combinations.  With wine and drinks for our kids, we were out for under $75. A deal for this quality food!  Highly recommended.",5.0,1

We went to the Pittsfield location.",5.0,1

"My brother-in-law and I stopped in here for some lunch after a backpacking trip; I had fond memories of eating here years ago, and was excited to be in the area again to revisit it. We asked about the soup of the day, and were informed by the waiter that it ""wasn't very good,"" and that the restaurant had a new chef who didn't seem to be in the waitstaff's good graces. We appreciated his honesty, and were both fairly excited to have heard a comment in person that we had previously only heard on Kitchen Nightmares. We ordered the vegetarian pizza minus the chevre, and, given the waiter's ominous tone about the soup, assumed we'd probably be sending the pizza back once it arrived. Sure enough, we spotted the white globs of goat cheese in short order (not before noticing the lipstick stains on our water glasses, though) and were promptly given a replacement pie which was, seemingly against all odds, really tasty and satisfying.

"""I wish those days could come back once moreWhy did those days ever have to go?""(Stevie Wonder)One of the prominent features you'll see as soon as you set foot into SoCo Creamery are the ""I Wish"" cards. There may be 500 of them taped all over the walls from floor to ceiling as though they are wallpaper. Customers are given the opportunity to share their deepest darkest thoughts by completing a note card with these printed words -""I Wish I Had the Courage To"".  Some responses are funny, ""I Wish I Had the Courage to Kill a Spider"", while others are quite serious and deal with divorce, coming out, and dysfunctional family relationships.SoCo is an award winning ice cream shop and consistently wins awards as best ice cream scoop shop in western and central Massachusetts. You'll see it  included in lots of Massachusetts Top Ten lists. We learned about it from an ice cream article in Yankee Magazine.The store is very cute and it was tough to decide on our ice creams of choice. We each went for a small cup which can include two flavors. My wife combined Almond Joy and Peanut Butter Mudslide and I combined Banana Brownie and Mission Fig. Each cup was $5.50.I really enjoyed my two choices. The banana ice cream was full of flavor and it had plenty of excellent pulverized brownies in there. The Mission Fig was as fantastic as it was unusual. The Mission Figs were ""hand-shucked by our production team"" and appeared on a Huffington Post '10 Best' flavor list.There was nothing about our experience that wasn't stellar. When you visit, be sure to carve out some extra time to study the Courage Comments written by customers.",5.0,1
"I'm not a big fan of SoCo. I think their ice cream just pales in comparison to Arethusa Farm's which you can get at the grocery stores in town if not at one of their shops. SoCo seems to have a monopoly in Great Barrington (no other ice cream shops around) and their ice cream, I feel, is overrated. I generally think ice cream that has egg yolk is better, and SoCo's does not. Tastes sort of one dimensional. I wish there was another option in Great Barrington.",5.0,1
"Considering we got ice cream here two days in a row I'd definitely say we liked it! They have a nice variety of flavors. Prices are decent and portions are large. I got a kiddie scoop both times and it was plenty!First time I tried the black raspberry chip because I needed non-dairy. It was closer to a sorbet than ice cream. The next day I got the mango sorbet which I preferred. They were fairly busy both times we visited (Mon. afternoon and Tues. evening). They have several tables for you to sit and enjoy your ice cream. While you eat your ice cream you can read all the ""I wish I had the courage to"" papers that customers wrote.",2.0,0
"An absolute top notch artisan ice creamery  I've only been once, but wish there more locations closer to me or that I may have an opportunity to go back! They have so many unique flavors that are so well done. I wasn't sure how I would feel about something like basil, which is normally used in savory cooking, but the lemon basil flavor was shockingly good. Black raspberry was also delicious; very smooth texture and refreshing taste.",5.0,1

"Wonderful ice cream! I got a single with two flavors (vanilla and lemon poppy), and my son got a single as well (blueberry/honey/lavender and vanilla). The ice cream scoop was more than generous and highly delicious! There was a long line but the staff were quick with attending and ringing folks up. Good amount of sitting despite the rush. The bathroom was big and clean. The parking was tough but that was due to the rush time we went; you can park a couple blocks down but it is small blocks and everything walkable. Truly recommend!!",3.0,0
"SoCo claims to be the best ice cream in Massachusetts and I can't really comment on that. What I can say is SoCo produces delicious ice cream!  Smooth, creamy and with fresh ingredients.

Enjoy!",5.0,1
"I read the reviews and saw that the honey lavender blueberries was mentioned many times.  So I ordered for myself and was interesting. We got mixed feeling for it as hubby thinks it tasted I soap, but I really enjoy the unique taste I never tasted before. But do prepare tat the lavender is very apparent over powering the blueberries and honey. Hubby ordered yhe cold brew chocolate chip. If you love coffee, order this. Strong coffee flavor with a really nice texture of the chocolate chips. I enjoyed the chocolate chips.  It just taste really good. Dear son had the strawberry his favorite choice for everything. It didn't not disappoint. There was bits of strawberry.  Didn't not taste like artifical strawberry taste. I love them all.  LolIf you are around the Berkshire,  stop by after lunch or dinner and you will not disappoint. I glad we made a detour back after tubing.",5.0,1

Walked in and was serviced quick. The ladies were nice however the ice cream definitely lacks ... We ordered the Almond joy (non dairy) - this tasted like coconut milk and mint chocolate chips nothing almond about it and the coconut milk base was not rich. Really disappointed I've tried some amazing vegan ice creams and this one definitely wasn't it ** also wish they had descriptions of what was inside the ice cream. Had no clue it had chocolate pieces... Cookies and cream (regular) - did not have enough cookies in it. Was basically just cream. Which sucked. Otherwise the flavor tastes better. I'd go to other ice cream shops.,5.0,1
Passed by this place and looked like a nice little icecream shop. Walked and had a very friendly staff. Boy they had a lot of different flavors and they looked yummy. The icecream I found was very creamy and had very good flavor. The kids also seemed to really like it. I won't lie I have definitely had better but I think for sure this place was very good. Maybe the next time around will try a couple other flavors.,2.0,0
"WOW. This ice cream is amazing! Came here during a trip to the Berkshires from NYC. Really extensive options with flavors and some pretty unique ones.I got a cone with the blueberry honey lavender and lemon poppy scoops! Both flavors were fantastic. The lavender and lemon flavors were both just the right amount, nothing too overpowering. The ice cream was super smooth and you could legitimately taste the icy texture. Still dreaming about this ice cream!",4.0,1
"SoCo should absolutely be a priority if you're visiting Great Barrington. I get tired of all the same flavors at every ice cream shop, but there were so many options here!

I ended up with the Midnight Cookies and the Desire (which was for sure the best flavor!). Overall a great experience.",5.0,1
"We ordered strawberry ice cream and black raspberry ice cream - neither were particularly impressive.  Strawberry had no noticeable strawberry flavor at all.

"SoCo is definitely a premium Berkshire ice cream spot. I've seen their ice cream in supermarkets before but never knew that it was from this area until visiting. We had the Berkshire Fog, which had lavender and tea notes while still being super creamy and flavorful. The texture is somewhat in between a gelato and hard ice cream. We came on a weekend so the whole street was closed off to traffic and it was nice to sit on the street. Great ice cream!",5.0,1

If I had a cooler in my car, I would have driven home a tubs worth of it.",5.0,1
The only ice cream place open in the winter lol but it was fine since it was so good. We came here twice while on vacation. Our son was living his best life in here with his huge cone of ice cream.

"Unique flavors, huge portions, lively inspiring interior, and long lines compose the experience at SoCo Creamery. I went for the Dirty Chocolate in a kids size cone. Holy-moly! That was the largest kid size portion I've ever seen in my life. The kid size is priced at about $4 followed by a regular size at $5. The dirty chocolate was not quite as chocolatey and creamy as I would expect, but it's ice cream and how can you not like it!",5.0,1
"I have only great things to say about this ice cream! My ONLY complaint is that the hours are pretty restricted, but not sure if this is because of COVID life changes.I bought 4 pints to share with my family: Ginger (super strong ginger flavor - amazing!), Blueberry Honey Lavender (unique, floral, strong lavender taste), Coffee (classic but well done), and Mexicali Chocolate (the mix of spices in this is mindblowing - I would order this forever if I could). They were all PHENOMENAL. In general, the ice cream was super creamy (no icy bits here!) with bold, strong flavors - you couldn't miss the 'title' flavors, which is how it should be!Logistically: The store has a case with some pints in the front, so if you know what flavors you want and see them there you can just grab them. We only found two of the flavors we wanted, though, so ordered pints when we got to the counter and the scooper went into the back and grabbed pre-packed pints - the process was pretty seamless. They were of course scooping in shop too, and giving out spoons/napkins from behind the counter to prevent contamination. We have literally dozens of local ice cream shops, and I STILL wish 'The Scoop' was closer to home!",5.0,1
"I just visited with high expectations, left disappointed. Offered large variety of flavors, settled on a scoop espresso cookie and peanut butter mudslide. Both lacked any depth of flavor, relying on sweetness, making them one dimensional- mediocre. Yet, the bigger issue for me was texture.  Extremely ICY in its consistency. Not creamy but grainy in a bad way. Tasted as though it had defrosted and was refrozen. Not good. Went with a group of people, all choices were similar - lacking in flavor and icy.   Everyone had the same feedback. I don't normally give critical reviews but their product earned this one.",5.0,1

"A small local ice cream shop in a very upscale area (no diversity). Easy to stop by if you had dinner at one of the surrounding restaurants. Not super busy when we went in but guessing it could get crowded in the summer.  Comfortable seating  area with  lots of space. Interesting flavor options available like gingerbread, banana brownie, and Mexican chocolate. Not sure if they make the waffle cones on site but it was not warm or soft like you see in places that make them on site. In any case, we enjoyed what we ordered. Service: Good service, nothing too note. Overall: Fun to visit since it is a local place and not a chain. Good ice cream with interesting  flavors. Nothing to note, would go here again if I was in the area.",5.0,1

I ordered the almond milk chai latte, but it tasted like a vanilla milk shake. I highly doubt that it was real almond milk! I have a feeling she forgot and made my chai latte with regular milk. But it tasted amazing all the same. Enough to make me want to walk out of the shop with 2 different kinds of ice-cream. Since I am always looking for great ice-cream.",5.0,1

"Eating this ice cream is a truly religious experience. It has been five years since we had it last and it was even better than we remembered. The flavors are brilliant and our family loves having the ability to combine two flavors into a single scoop. Today, two of us had the honey lavender blueberry (our favorite) with lemon poppy; our other daughter had hers with lemon basil. There are plenty of non fancy-pants flavors for those that are chocolate lovers and/or  the littles as well. Our nephew enjoyed the cookie dough. I cannot think of another scoop shop anywhere that is on the level of SoCo.",5.0,1
"My sister and I decided to stop by after we saw some customers nomming across the street with big cones. They steered us across the street. We were very excited, there was a line out the door. While waiting on line we looked up reviews for flavor recommendations. Someone said the cones were to die for, so we got two scoops on a cone to share. To be honest... I don't get it. It was alright. Nothing bad to say about the ice cream, but did not understand the hype about this spot. I think the best part was the almonds we got on the side for the ice cream. They were very crunchy and fresh. If you're craving ice cream, stop by, but I wouldn't go out of my way for this spot. Side note, if you're a coffee fanatic, the espresso cookie flavor, is mostly cookie, wish it had more of a coffee/ bean taste to it.",5.0,1

Been coming here a long time now.Why haven't I written a review?I just had the most outstanding ice cream today that I won't forget anytime soon - blueberry honey lavender!What a combo!

We were in the area visiting some friends who said this was a good spot for ice cream. I tried the Heart of Darkness which is an intense coffee flavor (scooper explained when they first created the flavor they had to reduce the strength by 3 times because it was originally so strong) and the Espresso Coffee ice cream. The former was too strong for me so I opted for the latter.Serving size is very generous. For $4 you get a hefty scoop about the size or a little more than a baseball.Staff are very friendly and helpful.,5.0,1

Eclectic selection of flavors, half regulars like Mexicali Chocolate and Mission Fig and featured flavors that make it super hard to choose. 2 scoops is now up to 5.50 but I think appear to be a bit more generous..add a waffle cone and you are looking at 6.25 ish. But hey, if you're reading this chances are you're on vacation and that cone will seem like a bargain here in the Berkshires. Make a night of it and enjoy a stroll up Railroad Street. Everyone has their favorites but the Salted Carmel is a winner in my book. Open later than many other spots and besides the Big Y, your only place for a cone in town .... Unless you can catch the Bistro Box with their limited 6 or so flavors.",5.0,1
"excellent Ice Cream and Sorbet, but a tad  over rated and extremely pricey. Big hang out in the evenings, enough seating when it's not busy, but people spill into the street when it is.Tons of interesting flavors. Good once in a while for a cone if you can find a spot.",4.0,1
"I've stopped in here off and on over the years and it never fails to disappoint. I don't get it-perhaps tourists write reviews on a sugar high. The flavors regardless of what they name them basically all taste kinda the same and I keep trying to convince myself this really was the flavor I ordered and not some generic sweetness. And you'll pay a decent price for it too. The deal breaker are the rules and regulations and the eye rolling staff. Seriously? Perhaps in the height of summer they have a city crowd they feel they need to control with their low fi customer service but the combo of the so so expensive ice cream and the staff ""customer service""makes this a vibe I want to avoid in the future.",3.0,0

From Boston to South Florida, I've been searching for the best ice cream I can find- and it's been there all along.Since before I can remember I've been going to SoCo whenever I'd visit my grandparents in Great Barrington. My specialty? ""What's the most chocolatey flavor you have? I'll take that with hot fudge."" To this day, I haven't found an ice cream shop with ice cream (or hot fudge) nearly as good as SoCo's.The past two times I've been to SoCo, I've noticed that their flavors have become even more unique and there's an even wider variety. From blueberry honey lavender to flavors with alcohol from local breweries and distilleries, there's enough flavors to make your head spin.My one request of you? You HAVE to try the hot fudge. Now stop reading and go get at least two scoops!",5.0,1

Most places that advertise a ""scoop"" make it a heaping scoop, but this was a very modest serving. And I didn't think the dirty chocolate was that impressive. Finally, the girls behind the counter were just plain rude. They had no patience for you if you were having trouble deciding on a flavor (and we didn't ask for any samples before ordering).

I thought 4.50 for ""1 scoop"" (which is actually 2 small scoops which can be different flavors) was a bit much, until I tasted it, then I decided it was very much worth it. Take advantage of the more unique flavors here and of course get those. For me that included their Mexicali Chocolate. It was prepared exactly how it should be, with the spiciness and kick, and yet I've never seen it at any other ice cream parlor I have as yet visited. The inside is clean and well maintained with probably enough seating for busier times (like the upcoming leaf-peeping season). If you're in Great Barrington, you need to visit here.",5.0,1

THE BEST.I was nervous because we had come in earlier to scope it out, and the sizes of the ice cream seemed tiny. My friend also said it was unusual (she works next door). But once we came back, I ordered a small scoop in a cone, and it was a very good portion. Everyone around me ""oohed"" and ""aahed"" at the bright blue ice cream. Jealous much?Best part of the night...we heard one of the people behind the counter seductively say ""Do you want to feel it?"" WHAT? FEEL WHAT? We whipped around saw she was referring to a cookie, which had been baked the day before. She offered a customer a chance to feel how soft it was so he could be reassured. Oh.

"So this is where it begins and ends for ice cream in the Berkshires. There is no better place for ice cream in the Berks than SoCo (short for South County). While ice cream is a favorite dessert of mine, I rarely have it on consecutive days. This all changes, however, when SoCo is minutes away. The Great Barrington outpost is always crowded, though one should not be dissuaded by the line that can often go all the way back to the bathrooms. It's worth the wait. My favorite flavors: coconut brownie, banana brownie, pumpkin chip, rocky road, dirty chocolate, salty caramel, and cappuccino crunch. Don't pass up the hot fudge.

Sure many kids will eat any ice cream, but this stuff is special. They also have flavors like fig, which is worth the calories.The staff is friendly, helpful and hard working, although during peak times they can get a little over run. Finally the pricing is more than fair for the quality that they deliver.Don't go here because they are the only ice cream place, go here because they are so good.",5.0,1
"We were in town for my birthday and opted to skip dessert at the restaurant we had dinner at when we heard of this ice cream place. My fiancé got a cup of the peanut butter cup fudge ice cream. It was the biggest disappointment. He basically ate a scoop of vanilla ice cream with one small swirl of fudge and no peanut butter cups at all. The ice cream was icy, almost as if it was thawed, frozen then served. My experience was slightly better. I got a scoop of blueberry honey lavender which was delicious. But I also got a scoop of the peanut butter cup fudge ice cream. I got my ice cream in a waffle cone and the blueberry honey lavender was on top. When I got to the peanut butter cup fudge flavor, I couldn't eat it. It was so icy I couldn't bear to eat it. Although my scoop did have one peanut butter cup. We were in the area and most reviews raved about this place. Maybe they had a bad batch of ice cream? Not sure, but we probably will not come back.",5.0,1
This place is awesome!  We came after having a mediocre lunch in town and we were so pleased with the ice cream and cuteness of this place!  Clean and comfy is best way to describe the atmosphere here.  We are from Long Island but will be back if we are ever in the area again!,2.0,0
I'm reviewing this afterbhavingngone to the Village Scoop in Hillsdale. So my opinion has been swayed a little. This ice cream was good if you're looking for a thinner and more icey consistency. Like iced milk more than iced cream. This was like Breyers ice cream. The flavors were good but not the best I've had  I sampled the banana brownie one and that wasnt pleasing to my palate. I ended up getting the coffee chocolate one(I dont remember the exact name). It wasn't bad.,5.0,1
"We went there and hour before close. No big deal, but the employees were obviously very impatient to close. Rushed us to take our order and we sat to eat our ice cream real quick. As we were sitting they stacked all the chairs and started mopping the floors. The unprofessionalism was unbelievable. The employee were sure to give us a 15 minute closing warning.",4.0,1

"I am allergic to milk so I appreciate when a place has a nice selection of sorbets. They had 3; all of which sounded delicious. I opted for 1/2 raspberry and 1/2 lemon because I love lemon and the guy that worked there (who was very nice and patient with me and my friends) said that Raspberry was his fave. Both were excellent, but I have to agree with the guy the raspberry was my fave. Delicious sorbets made with real fruits and natural products and friendly helpful service in a very clean spot. Would definitively stop here when I am in town again.",5.0,1
It was OK. I don't understand the hype.. the double chocolate ice cream was delicious. But the sprinkles tasted weird.. my friend got the strawberry ice cream and it literally tasted like straight up BUTTER. It was the weirdest thing.. don't get the strawberry ice cream..,5.0,1
"This is by far my favorite ice cream shop in the Berkshires, and we have a handful of excellent ice cream places. What sets SoCo apart is its commitment to using all-natural ingredients (so no alien-green food coloring in the Mint Chip, thankyouverymuch), and as many local ingredients as possible, so I always know where my snacks are coming from. It's even made right here in Great Barrington, so it's not shipped in from hundreds of miles away. Does it get any better?Have a bite, and you'll know it does! The texture of the ice cream is silky-smooth, and the flavors are rich and satisfying. They carry 20+ flavors in the shop itself, including limited-edition, seasonal bites, and collaborations with other local businesses -- for instance, the three coffee flavors made in collaboration with Six Depot (a terrific cafe in West Stockbridge), which are the best coffee ice creams I've ever tasted. The scoopers are also friendly and great at suggesting pairings, so if you want to get two scoops (or more!), they can help you pick something really special. The last time I visited, they suggested the Earl Grey paired with Mission Fig, and it was incredible. I'll be heading back every weekend this summer.",5.0,1
"What happened to this place? I used to come here years and years ago with my mom and i remember it being some of the best ice cream ever. Was in the area yesterday with my boyfriend, and was raving about it to him in the car. We both got black raspberry. The ice cream had absolutely no flavor at all and it was not creamy in the slightest. My bf said he felt like he was eating ""ice"".  We each got 1 scoop which was $10 for us both, which i guess is standard for Great Barrington, but we still felt ripped off because of the quality. The customer service was good though, and maybe it was just that flavor that was eh which is why I was nice and gave 2 stars instead of 1. But I'm still really disappointed because I had such good memories of here and it seems like they've changed :/",5.0,1

"2011 Head of the Charles main stand review: Stopped by the larger vendor outpost (not the cart closer to the Charles) to purchase 2 scoops to compare with the store-bought pints I used to grab @ Fairway in NYC. Ended up ordering the Pumpkin Chip & Macintosh Graham Cracker from the rude staff, neither of which were phenomenal, but neither of which were anything at which to scoff. The $5 was expensive, but given the convenience, I couldn't really complain. The tiny grab-your-own spoon seemed like it was meant for samples, if that. The DIY sprinkles kinda masked the ice cream, so I regret that; also nearly regretted having to hold the cup in my hands 'til it thawed out a bit.Kinda wished I opted for the hot chocolate (i.e., heated, liquefied ice cream) instead.",5.0,1

"I absolutely LOVE SoCo and their ice cream. The best! However just one teeny gripe -- some of the staff does not know how to make affogatos, and when I try to nicely request if they'd pour the espresso over instead of letting it drip in, I get strong pushback. By letting the coffee drip, it's no longer hot by the time it's served, and NOT the way it's done in Italy, that's for sure. Of course, now I'll get smart and order the coffee and ice cream separately, but for $7 I shouldn't have to be made to feel like a heel for asking for it the way it's supposed to be served.",5.0,1

I had high hopes for SoCo because my roadfood.com recommended it, and they were right!  As promised, the fudge was delicious!

"The ice cream is very good with interesting flavors available.  It is a bit expensive--over $10 to get 2 ""large"" waffle cones that are only 1.5 scoops of ice cream each.

"I had a good experience at SoCo, which I found thanks to Yelp. Overall, the ice cream was high quality and delicious. I had a regular sundae which came with two scoops of ice cream, hot fudge, fresh homemade whipped cream, and choice of one dry topping like gummy bears, M&M's, sprinkles, or oreos which were my pick. I had the dirty chocolate flavor ice cream which was as excellent as the other reviews promised and the surprisingly disappointing coffee, which was only average on the scale of coffee ice creams at large. I'm quite partial to this flavor, one might even say I'm a borderline coffee ice cream afficionado, so their take on this variety just wasn't up to par for my refined palate. I'd go so far as to say skip it entirely and try one of their other intriguing sounding flavors...what on earth does ""salty caramel"" consist of? I should've found out. My boyfriend ordered a Chai flavored milkshake which was exceptionally good and also much lighter than a gooey sundae. I would definitively recommend that item if you like Chai tea.Prices were a bit high but the quality was good. It was around $12 for the two items mentioned above. Service was average, but decent. The line got long right after we arrived so our timing was good. The girls behind the counter were taking orders and making all the treats, so I figure you have to cut them a little slack if it takes a few minutes. The owner or a manager came back to the shop when we were there and jumped right behind the counter to help, so kudos for that.Some random things to consider: Parking nearby appeared to be all street parallel parking which was in demand and fairly difficult to secure. The seating and the ambience in the shop were a bit mediocre in my opinion. I didn't care too much for their plastic chairs for some reason. Also, contrary to most other ice cream shops, you cannot see the ice cream through the glass counter which is a small detail but something that I thought was a little odd. They probably have to take more time explaining the unusual ice creams to people without the visual information, which most likely takes more time, thus consistently longer lines...see! I just solved one of their major logistical problems. Liberate the ice cream! Let it be seen by the public.",5.0,1
"This could be the best ice cream I've ever had.  And as you can tell from my Yelp reviews, I make a point to try EVERYTHING!  SoCo focuses on a few flavors rather than trying to make everything in the book.  This translates to high-quality, virtually perfect ice cream.My only gripe?  You need to open a shop in Boston!  The only way to get SoCo around Boston is to catch them in a store (i.e. Whole Foods) or at an event (Life is Good Festival in September featured SoCo).  Or take a trip to the Berkshires.Can't wait to have another scoop.",4.0,1
Went the other day after some recommendations. The ice cream in general was good but maybe a bit on the sweet side. I had Madagascar vanilla and rum raisin. My husband got chocolate and the honey blueberry lavender. I do have to say that the rum raisin was the best rum raisin I've ever had. Hubby's honey blueberry lavender was quite good. The staff wasn't super friendly and were a bit standoffish. Cute little place though.,5.0,1

"In it's evolution from Bev's all those years ago to it's current incarnation of SoCo, this is my favorite ice cream in the whole entire world. I'm sure nothing will ever change my feelings.Seriously, once you've had Dirty Chocolate, you will be a convert, and you will go around preaching the Good Word of SoCo. As they now manufacture pints and sell them around the country, I get excited when I can go to the gourmet grocery store up the street from my apartment, buy a pint of Brownie Banana, and indulge in a little piece of ""home"". Whenever I am with a friend at the grocery store and I see SoCo ice cream in the freezer section, I start my gushing praise: ""This ice cream is made close to where I grew up! It's the best ice cream EVER!"" After I compose myself and ignore the strange looks from fellow grocery store patrons, I move on, secretly hoping my insane exclamations made someone else buy a pint and become a convert.Some think it may be a little pricey, but when you use quality ingredients, you pay for it, and that's not a bad thing in this case.There actual storefront in Great Barrington is lovely, with enough seating inside to hold those looking to enjoy their ice cream in an air conditioned environment, complete with chalkboard paint-covered walls to draw on and a glittering disco ball lighting the way to the bathrooms. Outside provides a few benches to sit on, though many just stand and congregate, laughing and licking their cones. The outside of SoCo at 9 p.m. on a mid-summer's evening is just one of those lovely, quintessentially perfect summer scenes that you want to be a part of.Typing this is making me crave a pint of Ginger. Of course.",4.0,1

I have nothing but good things to say about this shop. Recently my place of employment started selling SoCo in Chatham, NY and I've never been happier!

"SoCo Creamery, you're the bomb. I just had some of the best ice cream I've ever tasted. You don't offer the widest selection of flavors I've ever come across, but even your standard favorites like vanilla and black raspberry are creamier and sweeter than elsewhere. You also have several seasonal flavors on rotation. When I stopped by on a chilly October evening, you were serving up caramel apple and pumpkin, among others. You let me try samples before ordering, so naturally, I went to town!I ended up with good old Rocky Road, and it was delicious. You know how sometimes you order a flavor of ice cream that's supposed to have chocolate chips or nuts mixed in and there's like three of them in the entire scoop? Well, you're not like that at all, SoCo. Your chocolate ice cream was loaded up with nuts and marshmallows, enough so that there was some in every bite. Perfect.You also have a few flavors of sorbet and fat free frozen yogurt, but it's definitely the ice cream that I came here for.  You're the best in Berkshire County, no contest.",5.0,1
"The ice cream was just ok- but the service was terrible - surly, rude teenagers who ignored us. After waiting several minutes and being ignored by 3 teens behind the counter (one was actually sitting on the counter but never looked up)we finally asked if we could order - and clearly it was an imposition. Owners need to teach and instill good customer service - we won't be back as there are other ice cream options!",5.0,1
"Very disappointing. We were so excited to go out for a cone on this beautiful summer evening. I completely agree with John S. that we would be better off at the local mass-market ice cream place. More on that below...We walked in -- there was no one in the store but three (3!) workers behind the counter, 2 male one female, staring blankly at us. Not even a hello. We kind of chuckled, it was so surreal. As we surveyed the flavors, I asked if the strawberry ice cream had chunks of strawberry in it. The female replied that she wouldn't know because she'd never been to the factory to see them make it (huh??) I asked if she had ever seen the ice cream itself, right there in the store and she seemed completely stumped. One of the guys who was more with-it and answered that it is made with real strawbs but there are no chunks. OK got it.So I ordered strawberry cone with chocolate sprinkles. She asked how many scoops. I asked her if she could show me one scoop, and I would decide if I wanted more. She walked over to a series of cups and said, if this were a cup, this would be one scoop, this would be two, and so on. So I nicely asked again if she could show me one scoop ""in the cone itself"" and then I would decide if I wanted more. When she handed me my cone I reminded her about the sprinkles. Without a blink of an eye, she informed me that there weren't any they ran out. I saw a bowl with Oreo chunks in it and asked if I could have that instead. No, the with-it guy said, those are for our bowls. (Mind you I paid SEVEN DOLLARS for this cone!)So now let me tell you something... my first job when I was 16 years old was at that local mass-market ice cream place. Before I ever put on the uniform to work there, I was drilled in ""the 7 steps of customer service."" Step one was Greet the Customer.  I can also tell you something else about that place. If we ran out of sprinkles, one of the THREE of us would have high-tailed it down to the Big Y to get more, and in the meantime, would have said, yes, Miss Customer, because we have none right now, and because for Pete's sake no one is even here to see us do it, I will give you Oreo crumbs instead. Sadly, Friendly's in Great Barrington closed a couple of years ago. But next time I want an ice cream, I will drive all the way to Lee for their more delicious ice cream and definitely better service!",1.0,0

I almost never get a single flavor ice cream (Ben & Jerry's Phish Food is my favorite store bought flavor), but don't get many opportunities to have dark chocolate ice cream.

The last time I visited was two nights ago. I had a small sugar cone with a scoop of Heath and a scoop of Banana Brownie ice cream, with chocolate sprinkles on top. The banana brownie was amazing, the heath fantastic, even the cone tasted better than other places cones seem to taste. My single complaint with this visit, however, was my poorly trained young server. The boy who was behind the cash register and scooping my ice cream was little more than just that - a boy. He looked about 16 with curly brown hair -- and I think it's safe to say he had no idea what he was doing. To start with I asked for the sprinkles on my ice cream when I ordered it. He then scooped my ice cream and handed me the cone with no sprinkles. I handed it back to him and reminded him that I had asked for chocolate sprinkles. He then went to the bowl where they keep the chocolate sprinkles and picked up a teensy scoop and sprinkled about 10 sprinkles over the top of my cone. After he tried handing it to me a second time I handed it right back and said that I would like more sprinkles please. Every time that I've been to this scoop shop (and any other for that matter), I have watched my server fully dip and roll my cone into the sprinkles. I mean come one, they're charging enough money for them as it is, and we all know sprinkles cost next to nothing -- I think they can afford to be a little liberal with them for their customers. My theory with this boy was that he was too scared to dip the cone into the bowl because he thought the ice cream might fall out. Judging by the slap-shod job he did of scooping the ice cream into the cone he might actually have been right about this. Rather than pushing the ice cream down into the cone it was sort of teetering helplessly in place, each scoop falling in opposite directions just waiting to make the dreaded plop onto the floor. As I've watched his more seasoned coworkers many times before firmly push the scoops into place in the cone, I recognized his own poor training/experience/mental capacity to be at fault here. Upon my second request of a decent amount of sprinkles he finally did indeed dip the cone into the bowl of sprinkles, which still resulted in only half as many as I usually get. I decided to give up at this point, as this appeared to be the most I was going to get out of this boy. A few minutes later while savoring the 15 total sprinkles I ended up with at a table near the register I watched a man who had also asked for a cone with sprinkles actually reach over and help himself to more once he had been handed his cone and while the boy was counting his change, as evidently he hadn't been satisfied by the meager amount being doled out either. About 5 minutes later I watched the boy walk out of the store still in full uniform and apron and go outside to hang out with a group of his waiting similarly pubescent friends -- while there were still people in line inside. I'm glad to see that my 50 cents surcharge for 15 sprinkles is going to good use paying his wages while he fulfills the street urchin duty that is evidently necessary for the operation of SoCo. Usually I get much better servers. Oh, well, I'll still be back as the ice cream is that good. One further gripe is that they have a credit card minimum. In this day and age I feel that you should be able to charge any amount you want, even if it is less than $10 or $5.",2.0,0
"The best (dirty) chocolate ice cream I've ever had. My friends and I were trying to describe it, and came up with ""elastic"".  You'll have to try it to see...it's the only elastic ice cream I've ever encountered. Incredible.",5.0,1
"I asked for a taste of three flavors and settled on the fig ice cream, which was luscious and creamy with big chunks of fig throughout. I do think the prices are a bit high, compared to other ice cream shops of similar quality elsewhere.",5.0,1
"For a simple ice cream place you would at least except friendly service, but every time I have gone there I don't get greeted, and I usually feel unwelcome. It doesn't make me very in the mood for ice cream...",5.0,1
"Lots of flavors here and they also have some sorbet and fat-free frozen yogurt. I went with a large cup with no toppings and went with the green tea flavor and the kiwi and guava to try the sorbet. My brother also tried the dirty chocolate so I tried some of that. First, the price is right at $5 for 3 large scoops of ice cream and there's a huge flavor selection. However, the ice cream and sorbet itself isn't that amazing. The flavors don't really taste authentic and some of them have a weird aftertaste. For example, the kiwi tasted more like sour apple and there's no way anyone would be able to tell that the ice cream was green tea because it basically tasted like a light less sugary vanilla. The dirty chocolate was OK but seemed to have a weird aftertaste, somewhat like some of the new packaged ice cream you can buy at stores that's sweetened with sugar alcohols. Not a huge fan of what i had here and I'll pass on it next time I'm in the area.",2.0,0
"Great breakfast place with good homemade food - there looked like so many good options but my wife and I chose the corned beef Benedict and the breakfast quesadilla, both were great - I would of liked a little more yoke out of my eggs but other than that the corned beef was very tender and just fell apart.",5.0,1

Service was great, atmosphere inside and out was very nice. We chose to sit outside on a nice summer day. I love that they have breakfast served all day! - just 1 breakfast item wasn't available after 11:00a but a whole menu of delicious breakfast items are available.

We ordered pancakes and eggs rancheros,  brewed iced tea and coffee. Nice experience. Nice staff.",1.0,0
"AWFUL SERVICE!! Waited for our order for over 2 hours!!! The waitress was a your girl that has no idea what she's doing. Kept serving people that came after us!! Unbelievable. Will not come back and definitely will be telling people no to go to this business. Also, the tables are full of ants because the tables aren't cleaned and left with syrup on then. The benches outside have some paint that ruined my boyfriend's pants. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!!",1.0,0
"This business is tacky and unprofessional. Not only did they open up 25 minutes late and walked right past me with no apology or explanation, but then wanted to charge me extra money to top off my copy before I left.

"It may be headlined as a Mexican restaurant, but we didn't order anything Mexican for our full, very reasonably priced breakfast. We arrived 8:30 AM and we're the first customers there, but by 9:00 AM it was half full - most people sat inside, but I'm glad we didn't (see photos below). Food was great and setting was beautiful.",1.0,0
"I was told that this was a spot to get smoothies and juices in the Berkshires. Boy, was that ill advised. I got the Amazing Greens (mango for banana with protein). I was concerned when my bill was $14.50 for one smoothie given that it should have been under $10 with the changes. The woman behind the counter said that's how much it costs. It was then that I suggested a price update on the menu board because it's misleading. Then she noticed her error, had a hard time correcting it and needed assistance. The difference was finally refunded 15 minutes later.She went on to make my smoothie, and proceeded to place a banana in the blender. ""Remember, I asked for mango instead of banana,"" I said. She was peeved, forgot the protein and handed me the chewiest smoothie I have ever attempted to consume. I would think that a restaurant with smoothies as permanent part of their menu would have a commercial blender. That was not the case here. The kale was not well blended and their were even chunks of unblended pineapple. All in all, this was a disappointing experience.",5.0,1
Put this on you list driving through Great Barrington. If it's open stop in. We stopped in on trek south for breakie and it was great. Authentic Mexican slant to some dishes.

"This is our absolute must-stop spot whenever we're in the area. We've been here four times and each time is better than the last. The ambience is super chill and relaxed.  No need to dress up  I almost always (once I got an omelet) get the french toast. Call me picky, but I'm super particular about my FT. It can't be too soggy or too cinnamony. Rio's version is pure perfection. Crispy around the edges, flavored just right. Superb.My husband gets the heuvos rancheros every.single.time and he cleeaaars the plate. Rio Cafe has nestled themselves deep in the hearts (and stomachs) of my husband and me. We will absoooolutely be back every time we visit the Berkshires and we recommend you do the same.",5.0,1
"Here for breakfast, the best breakfast we had in a lontime. We ordered 2 coffees (cappuccino and regular) hash and eggs (chorizo hash brown potatoes on the side).

I did love the blueberry pancakes though....slathered with butter and maple syrup (I hope it was maple syrup).  Soooo good!Our waitress was nice.  We didn't have to wait long.

"Horribly overpriced salad was almost inedible even without the hair (gross) that came with it. Kale had browned edges, butternut cold and mushy like it had been refrigerated a few days too long, and goat cheese slightly off. Daughter's crepes were okay on taste apparently, but two very small crepes rolled up with what probably amounted to less than one banana was overpriced and barely filling. Faux post-pandemic pricing seems to be in full swing here. The only reason it gets two stars is the location (lovely view of the Housatonic valley) and nice young man who waited on us.",5.0,1

We were not happy at all with our visits to Rio Cafe. The first time we ordered breakfast sandwich's to go. When we got home and opened the wrappers they didn't put the avocado we paid for. Everyone make mistakes right? So this time we went in person. The waitress comes over and takes our order. We ask for coffee and she brings two mugs over with the coffee we requested. We were never asked if we wanted a refill. So when she was at a nearby table we asked for more coffee. To our surprise she grabbed both our mugs and brought them up to the coffee pot and filled them up and them brought them back.(odd). I ordered pancakes with a side of sausage. She brings out my pancakes at 15 min later along with my wife's order. She tells me the sausage will be coming. I'm have way done with my pancakes and then got up to see what was going on because at least another 10 min had passed. As I got to the counter the waitress went to the kitchen and handed me my sausage. No apology for the delay. Needless to say we won't be going there anymore.,5.0,1
"Had a lovely breakfast at Rio! The cafe is spacious and overlooks a meadow and river. The staff was very friendly but most importantly, our food was amazing.

"This is really an underrated place to eat in great Barrington. First of all there is the setting which during nice weather is a beautiful backyard with widespread picnic tables on a grassy lawn with umbrellas. Very pretty view, away from the bustle of Route seven. Great place for kids to run around, dog friendly. I have never been disappointed with their food. Their fish tacos are literally the best I have ever had and I am a fish taco freak! I order them to pick up at least once a week. Breakfast dishes are great, their Benedict's are great, huevos divorciados is an amazing dish. I have not read the other reviews but there may be mention of slow service, which can be true because like many places in the Berkshires they are having a really hard time finding help. They are often understaffed through no fault of their own! If I know I'm going to be pressed for time I call and order the food ahead of time to go and then just sit at a table and eat it there. They also have terrific fresh fruit and vegetable smoothies, espresso, and many items that I have never tried. Delicious tomato soup. I highly recommend this place, the food is really delicious!",5.0,1
"We've been eating in this building for years, under various ownership and genres. This latest incarnation is the best yet. The interior is no longer retro-hippy but now has a pleasant cafe vibe. The people are friendly and helpful. The menu is a mix of Mexican dishes and eclectic summer treats. Breakfast is served all day, and there's an extensive lunch menu. Choices for vegetarians are excellent. I had the chile relleno omelette, which was absolutely delicious. Served with sides of real home fries and tasty guacamole, it was perfectly spicy: just enough that I never touched the bottle of hot sauce. Suggested improvement: cut off the stems in the kitchen rather than embed them in the omelette. My companion had the veggie burger. She enjoyed it, though like most house-made versions it didn't have enough structure to hold together like a real burger. After admiring it on the bun she deconstructed it and ate it with a knife and fork. A side of,cole slaw was tasty and well seasoned. It's hard for a new restaurant to get traction and succeed in its first season in the Berkshires. This one absolutely deserves to. And the great ratings from those of us who actually ate there will hopefully soon overwhelm the vindictive one from the guy who had to deal with a misunderstanding about opening time.",5.0,1

"Having lived in the Berkshires all of my life, I know it's hard for a new restaurant to get traction and be successful in its first year.

"First of all is pricy and limited food options.   There were four of us. 3 got the fried Chicken.  It came out as one leg and one small thigh.  No breast. It was served with some fresh raw kale with an oil dressing of some kind.  Also,  a small piece of corn bread.    The other meal was ""The vegetable plate"" it came in  a bowl.  It honestly was not appetizing or visually appealing.  It looked like a bowl of portage. The ""vegetables"" were small  stringy things mixed with soupy liquid mush.  No flavor!  These meals were $24.     In our opinions this restaurant was awful.",1.0,0
"A very disappointing experience with such high hopes. Ambiance/Aesthetic: cute but lacking in functionality. Not easy to move around, no signage, and nowhere to stand when you walk in and have to wait 10 minutes to be acknowledged by the host. Very very dark. The band, however, was fantastic.Service: our server was Barbie. She has a very basic understanding of service. She technically did her job. Not impressive but not the worst server I've encountered - she has no emotional intelligence or social awareness. Food: not good, sadly. The beet salad was probably the best thing we had but I'll never understand why people use frisée greens the size of the entire plate. The feta salad was wildly overpowered by the giant chunks of parsley and dill stems. Made a decent dish awful. Nothing on the entrees menu appealed to me so I went with the burger figuring that couldn't be too awful but I was wrong! The bun was not toasted. The burger patty was 1/2 the size of the tomato slice (which, granted, was enormous) and left at least a centimeter of bread around it. The burger (and tomato) were completely unseasoned. It looked like it was cooked to temp but who could tell with how dark it was. My partner was likewise underwhelmed by his entree. If you are going to have an 11 item menu, you should probably accommodate mods, unless the Chef is brutally unaware that his flavor palette is way off. Drinks: very limited, nothing with vodka, what we chose was not good.Also - the website doesn't work, there are no menus listed/posted anywhere. The menu also mentions a line about how their sausages, charcuterie, and other butchery are made in house but nothing actually on the menu - why would you include a line about this and not actually have it on the menu?? Accessibility leaves a lot to be desired. Safe to say we probably won't be back. This was a huge letdown.",2.0,0
"Prairie Whale was packed when we visited, but it's clear to see why. It's a first come, first serve basis, which can be tough for such a popular joint. Luckily we put our name on the waist list and posted up at the bar. I tried an orange wine and it was tart and refreshing. My husband had a special cocktail that had pims, gin, and a few other ingredients and it was delicious! Then we had a tumeric based mocktail that was refreshing. We eventually moved to our table and were ready to order! We started with a radicchio Cesar salad that was a terrific mix of bitter but well balanced with the fresh salad dressing and anchovies. We then ordered the duck tagliatelle which was incredible! I had the cod- cauliflower puree, olives, Brussels with a vinaigrette. When I tell you this was the best dish I've eaten in a while I am not exaggerating! We also got a side of corn bread that's topped with spicy honey butter. WOW! Do yourself a favor and come to the Prairie Whale and you won't be disappointed.",5.0,1
"I can't believe I haven't made a review for this place before, as it is my husband's favorite. The menu is always so clever and unique. We come here for unusual pairings and always consistently creative, excellent food. We popped in but didn't have a reservation and were able to sit at the bar and that was super fun. Everyone shared their comments about their food orders. All comments were very positive. We will be back soon.",4.0,1
Came here right when it opened so there was no wait time to be seated. Our food did take a while to arrive but it tasted fresh and delicious! The portion sizes were pretty big as well. It seems like they have a rotating menu so would definitely come back to try other food items!,5.0,1
Went here with mes amigos - we got the brussel sprouts (divine) and brick chicken (similarly divine..genuinely some of the best I've ever had in my life). Farm to table menu is very thoughtfully composed and we had a great time :) thank you!,5.0,1
"I'm Dominican. My husband is Puerto Rican. These two groups know shit about what the hell is a prairie whale. Found out it's a pig. None I've eaten in eons (and don't miss it). Blame my daughter's Muslim father.Hubs and I noticed Prairie on Main St during one of our day trips to Great Barrington and since then, looked forward to visiting. Menu is varied for any eating lifestyle- just let folks know to omit this or that and ask how it's prepared. I did. Prairie brings a slice of the countryside to this farm-to-table top spot in the area. Keep in mind, long holiday weekends, mean long lines. So when we came on a Sunday holiday weekend, folks had already been on line. Start lining up 1/2hr to be safe. Lunch isn't served. Only Dinner. Lounge while waiting for your table on their lawn. There's outdoor seating- but again, you'd have to get here before 5pm to take advantage. It's a rustic and woodsy space with a buzzy scene inside with Jamiroquai and modern-Disco playlist. Due to staff shortages, Prairie seems like they're only filling a certain amount of tables to avoid a rush of customers so we skipped the 1+1/2hr wait and sat at the bar. Bartender/server was friendly. Our meals were clean and unfussy, straightforward but intriguing and tasty (so is the rest of their menu). Between hubs' Caesar and my Napa Cabbage Salad, I don't know which one was better because they were equally good. Hubs liked his Brick Chicken and my Hen of the Woods dish was interesting. I expected lots more (way more) mushrooms since it's actually the star of the show and less of the roasted squash. It was good though and....small. Hubs enjoyed his Lemon Drop, my Cranberry+ Smoky Mezcal is something our Bartender/server 'crafted' on the spot since she had no Pepper-infused Tequila- and turned out weak. Great Barrington is known for so many things and one that stands out for me is their approach to food. And this is one place, I'd like to try again.",4.0,1
"What a disappointment. I was really looking forward to trying this place. The appetizers (pork croquette and radish/fish toast) were awesome, hence the 3 stars. I had the fried chicken which I actually liked, my husband's burger and my mom's swordfish was undercooked. The drinks aren't worth the calories or money. The service was seriously lacking. I suppose they are always busy because they don't have much competition in the area. We won't be back, we are happy to drive up to an hour to go elsewhere for a better meal.",3.0,0

"Showed up around 615 on a Friday, waited 45 mins for a table for two (completely reasonable given the current circumstance).  Gave name and number at the front and they text you when you table is ready. Area around back while you wait for your table to get pizza and drinks. Very nice touch. Seems to be two seating areas, one next to the garden out back under the tent where they put larger parties and one up front in the yard. Up front in the yard is much more intimate and quiet. We were sat at the table in the back with the families and kids running around the entire time. Not the best if you're on a date. Food was definitely the center piece of the night. We order a couple different things to try and grasp the full scope and feel of the menu. Started with the chicharrones, crostini and the tagliatelle. All three were very delicious and plenty for two to share. I opted for the lamb as a main dish and my other chose the fried chicken. Both came out delicious and definitely not short on flavors. Only negative was the lamb came out room temperature and the chicken was piping hot. Atmosphere and food were definitely deserving of a 5/5, however the seating we were given and the service is where it lost a star. Highly reccomend for a nice relaxing dinner in GB. Will be back.",4.0,1
"lots of local hype, with good food , a little fussy. But , I would go back with my wife if she wanted to....me? could take it or leave it. It seems like the Berkshires is getting filled with places like this- fussy, and hard to get into. Cape Cod has already underwhelmed itself in this sense- that unless you live there, visitors have a darn hard time getting a reservationmost of the time IF you do get in- well, the letdown is palpable. The food here wasn't the letdown, but it's not worth the effort. Give me a burger somewhere else.",3.0,0
"Not subbing for food allergies is a bit ridiculous in this day and age.

"Atmosphere: Low lighting and intimate feel. Loud music overhead and the sound of voices throughout the place. Customer diversity was not there. Food: Not for the  chicken fingers and  fries type people. They had some interesting options like brussel sprouts with fatbacks. Ordered a hot alcohol drink that was amazing. The food was well made and presented well also. Again, if you are not adventurous with food, it may not be for you. What we had was excellent. Service: Good service, nothing to note.Overall: I would go back for the drinks for sure. Food was good, not sure what I would order on a second trip.",4.0,1
"A Whale of a Disappointment!I suspect this place must be what Zagats would call a Teflon - an eatery so protected by its own history and laurels that criticism is simply incapable of sticking. But, stick it must!  I ate at the bar on a recent Saturday evening and the food was just short of abominable. A slimy, wan caesar salad, covered in grocery store parmesan and clearly assembled before the doors even opened, was followed by a brick chicken so drowned in pure salt and unidentified thin liquid that I had to check the menu on my phone to see if I had hallucinated the squash puree, tomato labne, cilantro, and jalapeno (I had not - they appeared in print but were notably absent from the plate.). When I inquired with the wait staff, I was told that the dish was As Expected, which honestly shocked me; no explanation was given for the long list of missing ingredients. Notably, the ambience was lovely and the front of the house staff were all polite and hard working. But, don't waste your dollars here if you actually enjoy tasty food - there was none in sight",2.0,0

"No air conditioning indoors (it's August....) and a mosquito swamp outdoors on the front lawn. A waiter walked around with one comunal bottle of ""Off"" bug spray to tables and said, ""This doesn't really work, but you can try."" It didn't work. Also the hostesses were super mean to me for not responding to their waitlist text (text ""1"" to confirm, text ""2"" to cancel) even though I tried calling (busy signal) and arrived within the scheduled ten minutes. Look, I get that I messed up, I didn't read the full instructions, but to be greeted with a salty ""Oh, you decided to show up. You're lucky we didn't give up your table"" and sat next to the bathroom is pretty aggressive. I even said ""wow, I'm so sorry, please know that my not texting back isn't due to a lack of enthusiasm for eating here, I just made an error."" It was as if I stabbed their dog. (Also, there's shoddy cell service in Great Barrington, and all the menus are available ""online"" with no WiFi, but sure...)We asked to move to the front lawn because it was over 85 degrees indoors. They begrudgingly moved us, and now I'm covered in bug bites. No citronella candles. No nothing. Just covered in bites. Y'all... I lived in the city for 13 years and worked in restaurants... you can't have Brooklyn attitudes if you don't have Brooklyn-level service or food. Speaking of which, food was absolutely just fine.Nice try, though.",1.0,0

"Came here to finally enjoy some quality dining experience during these COVID times.  They had ample space outside for outdoor dining and had large umbrellas to help shade us from the sun which was great.  This place is popular and quickly filled up 30 minutes after opening (we got there right when they opened for dinner at 4:30pm for this reason).Items we tried:-Pork spare ribs ($20 as of 9/20).  The sheer size of this dish is incredible (see photo for reference).  The potato salad was fresh and chilled which paired well with the ribs.  The ribs is coated with a sweetish bbq flavor so if that sounds appetizing then go for it, if not then steer clear!  The ribs themselves were very tender and fell off the bone easily.-Fried chicken ($18).  Recommended by a friend and we can see why.  The batter is somehow a perfect blend of spice and sweetness and the meat was extremely juicy.  Fried to perfection!  The cantelope was also perfectly sweet and was an excellent addition to the meal.  Cornbread was alright.  Only complaint is for $18 I wish they had more than 2 pieces of chicken.  A 3rd piece (even if it's just a wing) would help offset the cost but I can definitely see why it was recommended.- Mesclun greens ($6).  Honestly?  We ordered this because we needed some greens in our diet... pretty unremarkable otherwise though.Overall, worth a visit but make sure to either get here early or late to avoid waiting for a long time (no reservations as far as I heard).",4.0,1
"It was soooo yummy. Very nice service. Casual but high end hipster feel. We had the duck liver pâté, Frisée salad, chilled garlic soup, chicken tagliatelle, burger, broccoli raab, rice & beans and a cocktail and everything was excellent. Outside is a nice atmosphere for families. Chairs could be more comfortable, but we will definitely be back.Menu seems to change daily. There is a pizza garden out back, I imagine that's seasonal. Back there you can see the garden and all the food they grow on site. Ping pong.",5.0,1

"Came here with some friends after a short hike near the Berkshires.  Arrived around 530p and the place was bustling.  We ended up waiting maybe an hour for an outdoor table.  The outdoor table was perfect to keep the toddler occupied as well as to allow the dogs to join us all for dinner (a rare treat for our city dog).  Overall, the meal was great.  Prairie Whale has a good local draft list as well as a solid wine selection (albeit a bit pricey).  The food here was very, very good.  The house salad was fresh and dressed excellently.  I do not recall what all of us had ordered (we definitely had the brick chicken and the fried chicken), but everything was terrific.  Great ingredients, great presentation, and delicious.We will be back.Pro Tip: Bring some skeeter repellent or ask for some if outdoors during the warmer months.",5.0,1

"Prairie Whale is a likable farm-to-table spot in the Berkshires. Very much a rustic Brooklyn vibe. It's well-known in the area and we had about a half hour wait at 7 on a Sunday night back in October. They do have outdoor seating and yard games so the wait isn't too bad.We were fortunate that there was live music inside, kind of blue grass-y and very enjoyable. Even without that the vibe is pretty lively. Lighting is low and the decor is cozy and cabin-like. Service was prompt.They are serious about their cocktails, and both my tequila-based one and my boyfriend's whiskey and apple-based ones were great.The menu is fairly classic and meat-heavy, with options like pork chops and brick chicken. We split a pork terrine ($10ish) to start, delicious and well-presented with bread and assorted pickles. My pork goulash was divine-- do get this if they offer it.Make this your choice if spending a long weekend in the Berkshires.",5.0,1

"Some restaurants let their food speak for themselves. Prairie Whale, an unobtrusive homely restaurant with shaker style furniture and understated low key decor is one of those. Their Buttermilk Pancakes served with strawberries were excellent, one of the lightest and fluffiest pancakes I have ever tasted. The accompanying maple butter was divine. Polenta with Sausage, Soft Boiled Eggs & Arugula was the perfect brunch dish, hearty, gratifying and super tasty. Picture a perfectly grilled housemade sausage, two beautifully poached eggs and a serving of fresh arugula resting on a bed of creamy polenta rich with the flavour of cornmeal. Fried chicken with cornbread, strawberry jalapeño butter & spinach was equally awesome. The crispy batter was the perfect foil for the juicy chicken meat. The cornbread was a little dense although this was mitigated by the accompanying strawberry butter which was as light and fruity as sorbet.  The greens for this dish was spinach in a light vinaigrette laced with cumin. Whilst its brunch menu offered many regular favorites, with creative flair, Prairie Whale  remodeled standard fare into Rhubarb & Cardamon Scone, Bagel with Dill Cream Cheese, Frisée & Radishes, Sausage Biscuit with Scrambled Eggs, etc. This unconventionality is rather refreshing.Before we left, our server mentioned that their vegetables come largely from a plot just in their backyard and that their meat is sourced from local Berkshire farms. Well, that's another plus for this extraordinary restaurant.",4.0,1
"We showed up at 5pm as a party of 8, including two small children. After being told we'd be seated together, the hostess escorted us to two separate outdoor tables of four. We kindly requested to move the tables together but were told this was against restaurant policy. Not because of any particular social distancing concerns, but because they don't seat parties as large as 8.All in all, there was a frustrating lack of accommodation by the front of house staff, who mandated that our family dine separately. Furthermore, the manager was extremely rude to a member of our party who kindly requested whether a neighboring party of 3, who had just been seated at a table for 6, would be willing to move to one of four-tops so that we could sit together . Basically to the tune of ""you have no right to speak to my customers!"" Come on man. This is a hospitality business. If you can't be cordial to a family with (well-behaved) young children that arrives at 5pm, what are you even doing?Why two stars instead of one?

"Went here last year for lunch and though I failed to review it at the time it stuck out enough in our mind to return this year, this time for dinner. The restaurant has great mood. It's dark and wooden and just as rustic as you'd please. The service was also fantastic. We started with an appetizer of olives that were swimming a luxurious pool of oil that was perfect for bread dipping. However where they started missing the mark was with the burger. Oversized, sloppy, flavorless ground beef on a bun that just wasn't up to the task of holding everything together. The fries were good though. At a $20 price tag this burger left a bad taste in my mouth in more ways than one. Conversely the brick chicken was VERY good. While the bird itself was a bit tough the skin was crispy and the sides were absolutely killer. I could eat those dandelion greens and carrots every day. A real mixed bag here this trip to the Whale. I'd return but it seems like it could be a mixed bag. You may end up with a delicious brick or dudburger.",3.0,0
"We much looked forward to our family dinner at Prairie Whale, an upscale farm-to-table dining spot we've frequented in past visits to the Berkshires.Sadly, dinner was an expensive disappointment. Highlights? The burgers were good. But the vegetarian entree -- which featured beans and burrata and lettuce was surprisingly ordinary for something enthusiastically recommended by our server. The steak for two (market price at $100 for 25 ounces) was ordered medium rare and was served well done -- and beyond that, the cut had more gristle than we've ever experienced in a prime cut. Our server acknowledged the kitchen botched the order, but by the time she checked with them and the manager passed by to verify it was prepared poorly, the rest of our party had finished eating -- really too late to order a substitute. Again, we had made the Prairie Whale a regular stop during our annual Berkshire summer. After this meal, we'll look elsewhere.",2.0,0
"My absolute favorite restaurant in the Berkshires! Mark & the staff have created what feels like a home away from home. My friends & I always feel so welcomed & taken care of. We are treated like friends, & we consider them to be ours. Not to mention the food is absolutely delicious, & the cocktails are as well. The French fries are truly the best around, which if you are a fry-addict like me, is very important. The locals & out of towners who regularly frequent this spot know that the food never disappoints, & that of course keeps us coming back. But what makes this place extra special is the atmosphere. & the people. The wait staff & bartenders are engaged & happy & fun, & truly wonderful at their jobs - you can tell that they love working there & are treated well by the business owners. Perfect lighting, fun music, great energy. 20/10 would recommend. Grateful to have this gem in the Berkshires",5.0,1
"I came with a couple of girlfriends on our first annual ladies trip for a couple of nights here in the Berkshires, Here we were, so excited to gather at a recommended restaurant for dinner to eat outside during all of this COVID chaos. Imagine our surprise when we were met with extreme rudeness and arrogance. When we were extremely excited to have a dinner outside and be social, but to be put down and ignored within the service industry was just extremely upsetting and unforgettable.

"My wife and I arrived 15 minutes before opening. Another couple was already there before us waiting and uncertain as we were as to where to wait, what door to use, etc. So we thought we should just sit at one of their 5 outdoor tables until someone came out to greet us at opening time. About 3 minutes before opening time, there seemed to be a sudden rush of people from cars to form a line at a door. The ""Open"" sign was brought out and an apparent greeter loudly asked ""Who was first?"" Several kind people told him the order of arrival of people who, as we did, were waiting at tables. The greeter completely ignored the answer and said he was just going to go with whoever was first in line to the shock of those who truly had arrived first. And surprisingly enough, no one in the newly formed line spoke up as to the incorrectness of the actions of the greeter. I've never written a restaurant review in my fairly long life. But I felt I needed to in this ridiculous and very unprofessional treatment of potential customers. The first couple there left as well as we did. I'm sure that the owners of this restaurant will have someone write a superficial apologetic response that truly means nothing to those wronged, but will try to make it seem as if they cared. Which they don't. I've since read other negative reviews about this restaurant and we should have known better than try it.",1.0,0

The manager told my wife she didn't ask for outdoor seating even though everyone in my party heard her clearly. He then said he was standing there when she spoke to the hostess and heard her say inside. He was no where when remotely nearby when the exchange took place.

"We live in California, and during COVID when we couldn't go to our favorite Massachusetts restaurant, we've dreamed about the Prairie Whale and the three amazing meals we had not long after they opened. We met the owner and learned about his lovely family and planned to return as soon as we could. Tonight, disappointed by the San Francisco options available to us, we sat reminiscing about the Prairie Whale and decided to look at the menu and Yelp reviews.

"It was a very cool restaurant spot, but I am just not sure if it is cool enough to have waited 2.5 hours for it. Granted it is not their fault that they are super crowded, but just wish things would have gone smoother overall.  We arrived at 6:30pm on Sat night, hoping not many people would be dining this early, since they do not take reservations, but was told that there was a 2.5 hours wait. So, we wandered around the town area, got hungry, and snacked, which probably also attributed to how the food ended up being just okay... When we got a call at around 8:30ish, we rushed back to the restaurant, waited for a bit longer, then got seated. Overall, the food was good, but nothing that really blew my mind away beside how crispy the fried chicken was.  The cornbread was also good, as it tastes more like a cake, rather than a bread. But then again, is it good enough to wait 2.5 hours for? I'd admit that it's mostly our fault to try dining at a popular restaurant on a Saturday night that doesn't take reservation, but then I supposed I have waited longer for a restaurant and had a more pleasant experience. The service was also good, but not blowing out of my mind.  Given the amount of staff working there, I supposed I was expecting more service, but then again it's during covid time. I hope to visit again on a not so crowded night and reassess.",3.0,0
"Took a trip to Great Barrington to try this place. Was seated outdoors (expected). Our table was covered in ants. The host staff and waitress cleaned the table and ants were still there. We had to physically move the table. Also, wait staff took awhile to get our drinks/ food and nothing came out together. We also asked if we could have two separate checks before we even ordered our meal and the waitress said she could. She brought out one check, which wasn't a big deal but why say you can do two checks and not do it? I got the Caesar salad and side tomato and burrita. Food was okay.

"Friend loved the fried chicken and another friend thought the burrata with crostini was very good. I enjoyed the sun hole soup, tho other places have served it thicker, which is my preference. Also had the tagliatelle with ramps and prosciutto. Good, a bit salty... recommend sharing as it is rich. The place is loud, in an energetic way, and that makes it tiring, but still, I'd come back if I ever return to the area because the service was quite friendly and capable and I have experienced far worse food!!",4.0,1
"The best restaurant in Great Barrington!  The food is incredible, the scene is fantastic.  You will not be disappointed with any of the food you order.  Our favorites are the fried chicken, the hamburger and the pork sandwich.",5.0,1
"A must for Great Barrington (even in these ""uncertain times"")We've been here a bunch so I would say they've done a great job adapting to the current protocols. In normal times, we love it for:* Fun bar scene * Great drinks and food* Cool vibeNow we love it for:* Live jazz band * No crowded bar * Outdoor livingAlso, the pizza/almost beer garten in the back is a great add as well. Personally, the fried chicken is my go-to, but it's all delicious. And drinks are top notch",5.0,1

"This place, with its Brooklyn-hipster-in-the-country vibe, serves the best food in Great Barrington. For the food alone, I'd rather eat here than in certain ""fancier"" places in the area. The in-house-cured charcuterie is superb. The ingredients are local and the flavors are bold. This is gastropub food at a very high level. Pleasant convivial rustic vibe. Plenty of outdoor seating with heatlamps for maximum COVID compliance. Great selection of beers on draft, creative cocktails. My one criticism is that they should consider varying the menu a bit, even if it's a couple of off-menu specials per day based on what's good coming from local farms.",5.0,1
"We were in town for two days and had such an amazing meal on the first night that we returned for a second dinner!

Loved the ambience, and creative menu.  Options were fresh and local and delicious.",5.0,1

"Food was great.  Farm to table concept and reflected in the menu and signs around the restaurant.  The location felt welcoming and fit the area for a rustic restaurant with great foods. Also, a nice surprise was the 5 piece band that played during dinner (was there 3/20).  Ordered the Tagliatelle and all ingredients were perfectly done but what made the dish exceptional was the addition of an egg yoke on the top. Thought it was for effect but the egg added a great flavor to the meal.Friendly staff and understand why people commented it gets crowded.  Assume during the season you need a reservation for dinner.",4.0,1

"Overpriced food and TERRIBLE service. Our waitress was this young ginger lady who spent half an hour flirting with two guys at the table next to ours. We asked for a straw for a drink and she said sure, and instead went back to her conversation with the two guys. We ended up getting up to ask the bartender for a straw. (As an aside, he was nice, but put the straw straight on the counter. It didn't have that paper wrapping on it. It was just the straw. And he put it straight down on the sticky bar counter.) Anyway, it got so bad that at one point we were not sure whether this ginger lady even worked at this place despite having served our drinks. The other brunette waitress was slightly better. But she ended up flirting at that table too, all four of them sharing a bag of candy. I don't know. I can only report what we saw.Pork chop was overcooked and salty. Fish dish was bass and very underwhelming. Only gave two stars because brick chicken was decent and fried chicken was pretty good.To management, you need to train your staff. Those two waitresses may have gotten some hot dates out of the evening, but you just lost a party of 8 who could have otherwise become loyal patrons.",2.0,0

"Lively and cozy place even during the winter! Came here with some girlfriends and loved the food and atmosphere. Staff was also very nice. I personally had the lamb meatballs with some delish sauce (sorry about the details!) but everything was great. Apparently the menu changes often (if not daily) so would love to go back to try something new. The cocktails were also tasty, reasonably priced all around for the type of place and it's nice to splurge every once in a while. All of my other friends enjoyed their food too. One more thing, it says at the bottom of the menu that they don't modify their items but one of my friends that was with me is vegan and they still took of the cheese for her so don't be afraid to ask the staff and they were all very nice! Vegan and vegetarian friendly.",5.0,1

"This place was so great. My dad and I were passing through Great Barrington and stopped in. I had read about it before, so I was happy to see there were tables available. My dad had a pesto, squash, goat cheese omelette (with ingredients grown from their in-house garden), and I had the chilaquiles, both from their brunch menu. Mine was so great, best chilaquiles I've had outside of Texas. My dad really liked his too. Their wine/beer/drinks list was pretty extensive too; I had a great sparkling rosé, perfect for the warm summer day. The service was very good too, bringing out big pitchers of water whenever we finished one.",5.0,1
"I really wanted to like this place.  From the outside this place was so charming.  My friend and I went inside.  The interior was do inviting and warm.  I loved all of the long tables with the rustic elements through out.  I was really excited to try this place out.  The hostess greeted us and offered us a table but we decided to sit at the bar as we were just looking to grab some cocktails and a small plate to share.  This is where everything went down hill.  As we grabbed two seats I noticed the bartender roll his eyes as he instructed the bar back to take care of us.  We were offered water and given menus.  After placing our drink orders no one spoke to us the rest of the time that we were there.   No one asked us how our drinks were, no one offered to take our food order, no one offered to refill our water glasses, it was like my friend and I were invisible until I asked for our check.  Meanwhile the staff was eagerly chatting with a couple complaining about a recent trip to the Hamptons.  We were also treated to a show from the wait staff as they ragged on each other about the authenticity of their ascots.  Yes, you read that right - ascots.  In the thirty minutes or so that we were there I did get to observe enough rude and pretentious behavior to make me realize I will never come here again!  Apparently you can only get good service if you are a former Real Housewife of New York or you personally know the staff.  When I was finally able to make eye contact with the bartender to ask for the check he seemed shocked that my friend and I were leaving for the evening.  Don't let the cover of this book fool you, while from the outside this place looks amazing I've gotten better service at fast food restaurants!",1.0,0
"Absolutely loved our visit to Prairie Whale during a recent weekend trip to the Berkshires. We liked it so much we came back again for breakfast a couple days later.We sat outside for dinner. It was a bit on the chilly side, but we enjoyed the live music. Service was good, and everything we had from salads to mains was spectacular. The drinks were also delicious. Breakfast was equally satisfying and we left vowing to make sure to return as soon as possible.",5.0,1
"I really, really wanted to love Prairie Whale. It was fine. We weren't blown away. Three of us dined there recently. The service was OK and friendly, but not stellar. They really need to tighten things up. The food and wine came out at random times. Things seemed a little unprofessional - like no one was really in charge.The food was fine. One person at our table really enjoyed his brick chicken. I had the Farm Cheeseburger. I ordered it medium, but it was way over-cooked (completely well-done.) That sadly took away any flavor, so it was very bland. Another person had the simple Margherita pizza - and the crust was literally burned in parts of it. We were surprised a burger and pizza could be messed up. Given all this, the food is a little over-priced. So, overall an OK experience in a nice outdoor atmosphere. Just not sure it was worth the price.",3.0,0

"Enjoyed this place a couple of times for brunch in the pre-Covid days. Unfortunately nothing we got for take-out was worth it. Tiny burgers (best tasting out of everything, in the sense that we actually ate them), small bag of crushed, tasteless potato chips for $6 (they had no french fries and offered garlic mashed potatoes as a side for the burger?!), burnt-tasting broccoli rabe (which I love charred, this was inedible), and leathery fried chicken. Really disappointing.",1.0,0

"We wanted to eat something healthy so we went to Prairie Whale for their farm to table food.  Sat out side for lunch and was able to enjoy the breeze without being distracted by bugs.  Had Polenta & Sausage, which was not greasy, but very flavorful.  My friend had medium-rare Grass-fed Burger, which was perfectly cooked.  Pink without blood.  Had Affogato for the first time...yum.Went back for dinner because we wanted to try more dishes and sat inside since the bugs were out.  I had Pork & Peach, and my friend had Baked Chicken.  Both dishes were tender, juicy and flavorful. Despite not being hungry, we both practically licked our plate clean and went on to share a Peach Crisp.  Portions are on the small side, but it allows you to leave room for other dishes.Would definitely go back in a heart beat.",5.0,1
"Wow this was an amazing brunch experience! I've never tried a Bellini that tasted this fresh. My butternut squash pancakes were a huge serving and to die for!! I just loved everything about this place, even their coffee tastes exceptional. My friend had the burger (believe it was a simple cheeseburger - and I tried some, mouthwatering). Basically I wish I had more room in my stomach. Service was good, bathroom was clean, and the place had a very comforting sort of vibe.",5.0,1
My very favorite restaurant in The Berkshires! Service is Excellent and the outdoor seating is fun with cool yard games to keep you busy and entertained. .. or not. Food is delectable. Try Everything but My personal favorite is their  fried chicken with homemade corn bread and seasonal butter oh. my.god....You Won't be disappointed!,5.0,1
"Can we just talk about the greatest restaurant in the Berkshires? Okay, good.This place is amazing. I had heard about it because I knew one of the farmers. Knowing that the restaurant tried its very very best to be farm to table had excited me. The fact that the menu is constantly changing meant I couldn't go in with expectations. And the selling out of bloody mary's early in the mornings on brunch days meant that I had to wake my ass up early if I wanted one of their concoctions.So much of the meat on the menu is raised/farmed by the restaurant. This means that the pork your eating? It's damn good and hasn't been driven 800 miles to get to you 6 days after slaughter. Their meat plates, pate, pastrami...these were the first items I had at the restaurant- and I could tell the difference right away. On a 4th or 5th visit we came for brunch. Their fried chicken is some of the best I've ever had and I don't even think I'll try anything else. The bloody mary was absolutely perfect with the cutest (and practical! and local!) garnish ever. I bought the last one, and a couple of people came in after me trying to barter it away from me. The deserts aren't overly sweet- but their pastry/desert chef knows exactly what they are doing.The owner and staff are super friendly, attentive, and fun. This is the kind of spot we find down in Brooklyn, without the long drive. Definitely a place you can come hang out and feel at home in.",5.0,1
"Yesterday, my husband and I had brunch for the first time at Prairie Whale. It was great, and impressive in a number of ways- the service deserves a standing ovation. Let me explain.For starters: they were SLAMMED. It was Crunchy Brunchy: Level One, Red Alert. All hands on DECK.From my experience, the hardest kind of brunch service is when you don't see it coming- the unexpected result of some weird bank holiday or an uncommonly warm day in the midst of a cold, slushy winter. This weekend? BOTH. This weekend the stars aligned and people were flooding through the doors of Prairie Whale like irrational disoriented passengers from the first episode of LOST.People, chill out. You'll get a table, keep your pants on. TEN MINUTES IS NOT A LONG WAIT. You'll eat, you'll see your family again. There's no smoke monster- that's just the receipt printer.To the host/gatekeeper: You are a strong and magical wizard, and I salute you. When the bewildered lady asked why there wasn't a server assigned to the waiting area... like she'd just learned how to form a complete sentence... Oh, boy. I was reaching for my imaginary crossbow- but YOU proceeded with infinite patience and kindly explained that it is just a waiting area... which is, you know... not for eating, but for waiting. Honestly, I can't even remember what her response was- I think I blacked out. I definitely headed straight for the bar.But you took the high road, and  my hat goes off to you!At the bar, we had front row seats to the heart of this brunch service. I feel like it's the litmus test for a service team. Like, the truth is behind the bar. And the truth lies within BRUNCH.It was 1pm, high SLUNCH- the stakes were high, the glasses per customer ratio was EVEN HIGHER. Good lord! Zombie-like adult-baby customers were wandering about, waging war on the staff- by means of weird cocktails modifications and moronic requests that require additional inquiries and double-checking because of their sheer lack of sense, mystifying (and enraging) and often time-consuming (and STUPID) nature.As for the brunch staff at Prairie Whale? Well, the odds were against them, and yet THEY PREVAILED. Guys, WE HAD A GREAT MEAL. The service was SPOT ON, friendly and honest. The food, ALSO friendly and honest. My husband had the pork sandwich and I had the burger- and they were so dang delicious it stunned us into silence (we're generally very chatty- not sure how obvious that's become so far in this review!).Amidst the chaos of brunch, the bar emits a convivial vibe that I want more of in my life- we'll be back. And I know I've spent this review painting a picture. But that's with great purpose, as I'm waiting for my husband to wake up so we can GO TO BRUNCH AGAIN.So, for anyone who's clocked several hours of their life working brunch: you are all heroes. And, for those of you who've never worked BRUNCH... it's like this:BRUNCH 101At brunch, it's as though all practical knowledge and logical thinking is left at the door.  Everybody's hungover. Everybody's grumpy. And nobody knows how to behave like a grown-up. It's the only service where a 5-10 minute wait for a table can induce a soap-opera worthy reaction, complete with animated eye-rolls and dramatic door-slamming exits. The unwarranted aggression and bad attitudes are stunning and unrelenting, and sometimes very amusing! And just when it feels like it must be close to being over, you look the the time... and it's actually only 1pm. WOOF.Working brunch is not for the faint of heart. It's often thankless, and it's also very sweaty. By 3pm you smell like a burger, and feel like soggy plate of discarded home fries. But there's still silverware to polish. And bus tubs to fill. And still SO MUCH GLASSWARE to clear.But there is also some beauty hidden at the heart of every brunch service. You build strong friendships, you form a solid working wolf pack. In navigating the turbulent emotional storm of brunch, you become a better human. You learn what true patience is, you find excuses to do nice things for people because you need it to survive. Good deeds become your life force. And that's the needle in the brunch haystack.Brunch: It's breakfast. And it's also lunch. It's messy, and that's okay. Because it's kind of like going to war. And then getting to go home. It's like being stranded on an island and making friends with a volleyball named Wilson.The KEY: know when to hustle, know when to laugh, know when to make snaquiris for the staff because you have a couple of moments before another 8 drinks are needed ON THE FLY for a table of TWO PEOPLE. 8 DRINKS, 2 PEOPLE. WHY?!?!?!????!!!!!Brunch. That's why.The brunch staff at Prairie Whale knows how to work that brunch like a boss. And we'll be back for more foods and drinks and good times, and soon! MAYBE TODAY! OXOX",5.0,1
"Came here as part of a day trip to Berkshires - overall opinion: mediocre at best. Over an hour+ wait for a table (they don't take reservations), and the hostess with blonde curly hair had a major attitude/ was not welcoming.Drinks were okay and food was average at best - i.e chicharrones were over salted, chicken wings were basically all bone/burnt. HOWEVER, our server Sarah was awesome - super warm and friendly (again, especially compared to the hostess/host) and gave great service overall! 5 stars for her.",2.0,0

Squash ravioli was quite nice, but not super.Our waitress was very bubbly and friendly. The music is cool and there are people of all ages there. A very warm place to go to on a cold night.",4.0,1

"Drove an hour here for my birthday, solid apps and drinks. Service was spotty much like the other reviews say. We were seated, placed drink orders with what seemed like a manager, 5-10 later our server for our section came over and asked if we wanted drinks, clearly no communication. As I said, appetizers and drinks were on point. Ordered rib eye, brick chicken and scallop dish. Steak was a little under cooked for what I ordered but grade A meat. The brick chicken was under cooked and was sent back. They comped drink and dessert, very fair, not upset about it. Biggest complaint was the pace, for the price I would have really enjoyed someone to come clean off the table and switch out silverware. Our plates from apps weren't cleared prior to our entrees came. Small, but I don't think they are unrealistic for the price/hype. Seems like it's past it's prime.

"This place used to be good, but has gone downhill, while the prices remain the same. Went tonight for the first time since before the pandemic, and it was very disappointing. I ordered fish, and then 5 minutes later was told they ran out, so I tried to quickly find something else on the menu that looked interesting, but couldn't. So, I went with the fried chicken with honey entree...what did I get? 2 pieces of chicken in a small bowl with honey already on them. This is not an entree! And at least give the honey on the side. We ordered a burger for my son with no cheese, what did we get? A cheeseburger! I told them and they brought it back in 1 minute with no cheese, so had apparently just scraped it off. The watermelon cooler I ordered was pretty much tasteless, the pasta was undercooked, and the flourless cake was tasteless. We ordered cornbread and the waitress didn't bring it or even remember we ordered it. And the grand total was $281 before tip!!! My wife ordered the steak, which was $48 and just average, with only fries! Never coming back again, what a waste of money :(",2.0,0
"Really cute place! We met my parents there for a birthday meal. They had a really interesting selection for brunch on a Sunday. By 1:30 it wasn't very busy either, so we had no problem getting a table. We basically had an array of sandwiches and they were all super tasty. I had the country pate. Nice selection of beers on draft and in bottles. They had a couple Founders, one of my favorite brewers. It's restaurants like this that keep me coming back to Great Barrington.Only bad thing was the portion sizes. My plate was mostly covered in mustard greens. The sandwich itself wasn't that big. Neither was my wife's, although as she said, people shouldn't be eating huge sandwiches anyway. But these were all between $12 and $14. I always try to take value into account in my reviews, so I have to knock off a star for that.",4.0,1

"Well this was a surprising find! This is a restaurant that's situated in a blue house. TOTALLY wouldn't have known it existed if my family didn't tell me about it. We came for brunch on a Saturday. The food is all ""farm to table"" and the bottom of the menu states they get their meat and butcher it in house. Homemade sausage, bacon, etc. Pretty impressive.Overall, the family was very happy with the meal. There isn't much of a point in discussing the specific foods since the menu changes all the time, but overall food was super well executed. Interesting combinations, well-prepared meals and my brother said the bloody mary was delicious (and it came with a beer back). Next time in the area, I'll definitely come back. I want to try dinner next time :)",4.0,1
"Tried to eat here but was told to leave by someone who was having really bad night. I waited in line 8 minutes to be seated by host (busy Monday night), and explained I just wanted salad or light dinner. He told me to go in back patio as this was more suited for my needs. I sat down ""in back"" but was ignored by service staff for 11 minutes. I finally asked if I was in right place, and was told to go see ""Abby"" in ""Pizza Garden"" which was just another nearby  set of cheap rental tables. These were occupied so after waiting another 6 minutes I went back to ""Host"" in front to find out how I could get on special waiting list. He told me just ""to leave and find someplace more suited for me.""  He added ""this is Pandemic"" and that ""I need to understand that.""Pandemic or not, in 60 years of dining out all over the world (including rude Paris), I have never been ordered to leave as I was patiently waiting.

The fried chicken was seasoned well and yummy. The burger was pretty good, nothing amazing but not bad. Overall a good meal, very cute ambience.",3.0,0

"Done with this restaurant! As a frequent summer visitor to the Berkshires, I always like to visit the Prairie Whale since it opened and was originally named the Bell & Anchor. Have I ever had a great meal here??? never but food was just okay and ambiance and vibe was even better. My last few visits have been so disappointing that I finally felt compelled to review it. Last night (Monday evening) we took some young guests and were ushered to a banquette near the bar. For a Monday night there was a lot of buzz going on there but the owner was not there. Everything we asked for on the menu was not available ... why would they even open the place for the night and why weren't we told before we were seated that the menu would be limited due to lack of inventory or deliveries ?? This was so rude and so embarrassing for our guests who were nicely settled into our seats and we just went with  whatever was available on the menu... I literally ate a bowl of vegetable soup that must have had a bucket of salt in it and the rest of my party had very lackluster meals... hoping they get their act together in this place along with a new chef. Otherwise just grab a drink and play some games on the lawn because the food is downright awful!",1.0,0
"Was initially hesitant because I was concerned this was more style than substance, but this is a really lovely spot.  Great ambiance - perfect for grabbing a drink or sitting down for apps and dinner.  I also appreciate that some areas of the restaurant are quieter than others, so our group could easily chat with one another over dinner.  Cocktails, as well as the wine and beer selection, were excellent.  I really loved the menu - we ordered oysters,braised short rib (absolutely delicious), chicken, and soppressata app.  Waitstaff was SO NICE - a group of us walked in for a special occasion and we were seated within 5 minutes and we got superb service.  Nightlife in the Berkshires can be.... subdued.... so this is a great option for a night out.",5.0,1
Food was just ok and server was very pretentious. The bread board was the best thing we ordered. The burgers were requested well done and came out between medium rare and medium. There was nothing special or flavorful about them. The fried chicken was a bit greasy. The brick chicken was probably the best dish.,2.0,0
"Ring the bell and put down anchor - There's a new port in town! Bell & Anchor is finally here, and it seemed last night as if the villagers had gotten word. Yes, it was 'Friends and Family' night with nearly the entire population of The Berkshires in dock. Good news: There's ample parking and plenty of space to avoid the rubbing raw of elbows with said friends and family.The vibe is Brooklyn meets Pub (picture an abundance of wood, candlelight, and hipster glasses,) and the fare is in line with that vibe. Cassoulet, Lamb shank, Fried beef cheek, and fries fried in duck fat. Apparently, cholesterol-levels are not an issue when you enter Bell & Anchor. That's fine with me. Bring on the duck fat!You may be wondering why the 3-star review? Given that the place is new, I'm giving it room to get it's sea legs in terms of menu, which is limited. A few more options would be recommended by this lowly diner. If not, I'll be fine sticking to the great cheeseburger served with (you guessed it) fries. On a menu like this with heavy, meat choices I humbly suggest adding some vegetable sides to be ordered in tandem or in combination. I would have killed for a side of sautéed greens to cut through that duck fat and give me the illusion of having made a healthy choice. Just a suggestion.I'll be going back to see if the remaining star or two are garnered by Bell & Anchor, and I suggest you do the same. So, take sail, find your slip at the bar, and enjoy.",3.0,0
"We only discovered this place on our second and last night in the town but it was good enough that we changed our plans to get to have dinner here again.The waitress recommended the home-grown meats (lamb and pork) and, boy was she right.

"If you go for dinner, bring a flashlight!We go here pretty frequently for brunch, which is nice.  They have good cocktails and enough vegetarian options that are pretty delish.  I generally like the atmosphere - we often sit at the bar, but the music tends toward the crappy - middle of the road classic rock, heavy on the Creedence, often at an unpleasant volume.  Look up to make sure you're not seated under a speaker if this kind of thing annoys you.However, we went for dinner recently, and were not the only people who had to pull out cell phone flashlights to read the menu.  We complained, but the staff said there was nothing they could do! Service is frequently abysmally slow.  If you get bad service, make sure it is reflected in your tip & maybe they'll be moved to clean up their act in future.  No excuse for this - often it does not appear remotely busy when they take half an hour to bring you water, etc..They have a wood stove, which is nice in winter, natch. The front room is a little brighter and quieter than the rest of the space.It's still our fave spot for brunch in GB.If you're having a drink, you're looking at $$$, otherwise you might get by with $$.",3.0,0

"I have been coming to the Berkshires for about 15 years and always loved going to places in Great Barrington.  I didn't start coming to Prairie Whale until about 3 years ago but it's now one of the biggest reasons to drive to Monterey or GB.  I usually go for brunch and always get the Fried Chicken, with corn bread and jalapeño butter.  The Bloody Mary is also a great drink there, since they use the right amount of Worcestershire and Tabasco sauce.I recently went there for dinner and got the soft-shell crab sandwich, which was SO good.  The coffee is also always great.Usually, I have a male server who is always very nice and perfectly attentive, so I'm happy when I see he's there.",5.0,1
"I more or less staid overnight in Great Barrington so I could eat at Prairie Whale so that should tell you how excited I was about it.  Sometimes this is a recipe for disappointment as you can build up a place into something it isn't.  I'm happy to report that that isn't the case here.If you aren't prepared to wait an hour, do not come here on a weekend.  Prairie Whale seems like the most popular restaurant in town.  Fortunately they have a great bar with excellent cocktails and a small but pretty good beer and wine list.  We started with cocktails at the bar.  Mine was a spicy drink made with jalapeno infused tequila, grapefruit juice, and bitters topped with a splash of soda water.  I'm not sure what I expected but it was really spicy and I'm used to spicy food.  I kind of assumed it would also be sweet, but Joe, the bartender, managed to make a dry, spicy, strong cocktail.  It was great.  I'd tell you to get one, but they seem to change the menu a lot so there's a decent chance it won't be available.The food is as good as the drinks.  We started with a salad, which was greens topped with roasted beets, nuts, and goat cheese.  Like, a lot of goat cheese.  This is one of those salads that is sneakily unhealthy, but I honestly don't care.  After the salad came the pate with country bread.  This was another hit, with 6 decent sized slices of pate, greens, brie, mustard, hot pickled peppers and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting.  Pretty generous portions for a meat and cheese board, but it was also $12.  I'd definitely order it again, maybe just to get the pickles.  Finally, the chorizo tagliatelle.  This dish was one of the best carbonara's I've ever had.  Perfectly cooked pasta, spicy chorizo, tiny mushrooms that soaked up whatever they were cooked in, and a creamy egg sauce.  The space, occupying the first floor of an old house, is really nice at night.  They keep it pretty dark, but I didn't have any trouble reading the menu.  Prairie Whale is a bit pricey, but you can eat a meal here for a reasonable amount of money.  The food portion of our bill was only $42 which isn't bad considering the quality of the food.  Unless you insist on leaving absolutely stuffed, it's possible to eat here without emptying your wallet.  Now that I've had three dishes here, all of which were great, I'm inclined to come back and empty my wallet.",5.0,1
"Great atmosphere and service! We arrived on a cold April afternoon at the end of a random little early spring snowstorm. Walking into the warm, cozy, candle-lit space was just what we needed. The server was wonderful, going over the menu in detail with us. Even though it was super busy, she couldn't have been more attentive. Food-wise, it was really nice. The menu is unique, but there are limited choices, so don't go expecting 50 entrees to choose from. It's farm to table, and it sounds like the menu changes a lot with the season. We shared a yummy pasta app, and the wine I had with it was perfect and suggested by the server. My friends loved their entrees. I liked mine (cheeseburger) but it was just a little salty and so thick that it was awkward to eat. I ended up eating it with a fork. Dessert was AMAZING--passion fruit creme brûlée was the best one we had, but the cookies and caramel sauce were fabulous as well. On the downside, I thought the prices were high given the more casual atmosphere (entrees mostly in the mid $20 range, and the burger was in the high teens). We were on vacation so we sort of expected this, so we just went with it. All in all, I definitely suggest eating at Prairie Whale if you're in Great Barrington.",4.0,1
"This is very much a five star restaurant, as long as your expectations are correct. This is not Ruth's Chris, there will not be someone brushing the crumbs off the white linen in a quiet, candle lit dining room. Insead, what you get here is authenticity. All of the food is sourced locally, most from their own farm, and some, such as bread, is from Camphill Village, on the other side of the NY border. All of the meat is butchered on premises, and all of the meat products are made inhouse. The bar manager is excellent, and the rest of the bartenders very a pleasure to interface with, and learning quickly. The place itself had a country restaurant vibe to it, and the food was all hearty. The burrata toast was hearty, the fried chicken was perfectly cooked, the onion rings on the pork sandwich were crispy pickled red onion, and the jalapeno butter on the cornbread was a great idea. The liquor, beer, and draft selections were all excellent. I've seen significantly more taps, and much larger selections, but this was by far the best selection that I've ever seen. I can't wait to come back here!",5.0,1
"This place felt like we went to a chef friend's house for a garden party...ping pong table & bean bag toss out on the lawn, packed bar scene with tons of specialty drinks, a really cool rustic farmhouse vibe, amazing cornbread, fried chicken that would fill the craving for comfort food, and delicious, perfectly seasoned & broiled porgy.  Great service, great atmosphere & amazing fresh food.  Would definitely come back here!",5.0,1

"Prairie Whale is situated in an old large house with an old-warm-wood yet hip feel.Food in general is excellent, and on our recent visit their tagliatelle with broccoli rabe, Italian sausage and egg yolk was over the top great.They have a good wine and beer menu, although not many wines are offered by the glass. Service is knowledgeable, very friendly and helpful, and prices fair for the quality of the food.  (Bread is an extra charge).The menu changes regularly and tends a bit towards heavier dishes, but you won't be let down.Definitely worth a stop.",4.0,1
"If you are a conservative old man like me DO NOT let the skin inked, body piercings stop you in your tracks with your family. This is a A hipster place and the food is executed with precision! I had the caesar salad. It was served with the white boquerones and jellied eggs. My daughter had the kimchi kale dish. Let me just say she was practically drinking the sauce at the end. My wife ordered the burger. I think you would be hard pressed to find a better burger anywhere. They nailed it! We also ordered a side of fries. They came with mayo instead of ketchup. To some that live south of the french Canadian border this may be french fry Armageddon. I found it a nice tough. Lets not forget local sourced ingredients, local beers and a cask conditioned ale from time to time. My only complaint was they were not very receptive to any changes to an item other then fries for a salad. Worth a minor detour to eat some great food.",4.0,1
"To begin with, I left a msg asking for a copy of the upcoming menu. I received a call back in the morning and a promise to send me the menu in the afternoon, which they did not forget to do. The food was amazing, from the simple side salad - wonderfully fresh with deliciously light lemon vinaigrette and fried potato appetizer (delightfully spiced) to the Vegetarian Entree full of surprising subtlety and flavors, and the Brick Chicken - also delicious with wonderful vegetable sides. And the desserts! I had the Sage Creme Caramel - amazing and unexpected flavors! The service was fabulous. Everyone was so warm, genuine and delightful. The vibe is both cozy and cool. My partner and I both felt this was the best dining experience we have had in ages.",5.0,1
"Sitting out on the deck on a warm summer Friday night in early September was quite pleasant.  The wait for a table at 8:15 was only about 5 minutes.  Began with the charcuterie plate, which included pate, pork rillettes and headcheese.  It came with great bread and fantastic whole grain mustard.  The pate was coarse ground and good.  The rillettes and headcheese can be an acquired taste and reviews on them were mixed. One entree was a bowl of very large black beans (can't remember the name of them) with a piece of hake.  Too many beans, too little flavor.  The other was a massive pork chop, with a ring of fat around it about an inch thick!  It was just OK - not as flavorful as expected. This is supposed to be one of these locovore farm-to-table restaurants, which made the wine list odd - nearly all French and European wines.",3.0,0
"We waited almost an hour for 2 people on a Friday night. It was worth the wait. We started off with the burrata salad which was very good it was also served with two fried green tomatoes. My fiancé got the sausage tagliatelle. It was delicious but the serving size was small. Probably half the size of a serving at other restaurants. He was still hungry after eating that. So we ordered a side of corn bread. Slightly overpriced $6 for two pieces of cornbread but it was very good. My dish was spectacular. It was a quinoa dish with summer squash, falafel and fried green tomato. I couldn't believe how good it was. It was a lot larger than the pasta dish, he ended up eating half of mine. It was very filling and delicious. I don't usually order vegetarian dishes so I'm not sure how this compares at other restaurants.",5.0,1

"Went to the PW with 2 families...2 couples and 4 kids under the age of 6, on Sunday evening.The upside of the Prairie Whale is that the food is good, a couple of the dishes bordering on very good.Downside is basically everything else.  And that everything else ruined what could have been a nice evening.Service was cranky, and seemed put-out when we asked for help.  Nobody ever came to check on us or see how we were doing.  Lot of attitude for out here in Western Mass.Prices are pretty high, and the portions are pretty small.But what bothered us the most was-  we ordered plain pasta for all 4 of our kids.  Tiny little side-dish pastas arrived...which were immediately devoured.  The portions were small -- so we had to order ""another round"".  In the end we ended up with 7 orders of plain pasta (for four kids under 6).  The cost for each?  $8.  So basically, we paid $56 for a bowl of plain pasta.  Indefensible.  I don't even mind paying eight bucks for a bowl of pasta....but these orders were so small that we had to order TWICE to satisfy little kids under the age of 6.Also, give me a break dinging me $4 for a tiny 1/4 baguette.We left feeling taken advantage of on dumb things like plain pasta and bread.It's silly stuff like this that keeps locals from making this a favorite.",1.0,0
"Food was interesting and executed pretty well. Service was terrible. It is not so much that it was bad, which it was, but rather that NO ONE cared. I can live with a longer than quoted wait time. 15 minute to get a drink at the bar? I can't substitute another vegetable for a salad? I just ate a salad for an appetizer, I don't want another one on my plate. Never saw an owner or manager even though it was obvious we were not happy. Maybe I am alone in this world when I think about expectation levels for food and service. Maybe they can fix this issue. May have to start with the Ginger waitress. She was our server as well.",2.0,0

"Went with party of five on Friday night at 6:30 during Christmas week and waited an hour for a table, but it was well worth it, so don't run away if other diners are lingering and delaying your dinner. The front-end manager was very transparent when asked about the wait. Once seated there is a very cozy and relaxing atmosphere with attentive staff who kept the table uncluttered and carafe of ice-water filled. Started with Caesar salad, beet salad, and generous bowl of olives. Fried Chicken, tagliatelle, brick chicken, and grilled pork chop for dinner. All with chef-chosen sides so please resist the urge to try to change these complementing combinations. Desserts: Affogato - vanilla ice cream with single espresso and buttery biscotti on the side, Hot toffee, and chocolate mousse topped with olive oil. With 4 glasses of wine the bill was $250, which is reasonable for this level of dining. We did not miss having bread, but here there is a nominal charge for bread and butter.  There are 3 separate wine lists so ensure you see all of them if interested in bar options. Excellent dining experience and we look forward to coming back.",5.0,1
Great little spot in Great Barrington. The food was delicious. I ordered the chorizo and my boyfriend ordered the duck. Both had great flavor and the veggies were fresh.

Cocktails were interesting - anything with gin and grapefruit is good by me and the added salt was a little twist. Can't wait to go back for dinner!",5.0,1

"I love this place so much that it's embarassing. It's a delicious taste of hipster brooklyn right in the Berkshires. The shole aesthetic of 'artisinal' rusticness, type - written menus, and beers served in mason jars should be all-too familiar to anybody who's ever walked down Bedford avenue. It all elicits frequent eyerolls from the friends I drag here, but the management comes carrying such an impressive pedigree (Diner and whatnot) that I say they can get away with that shit. They're real OG hipsters. And they cook some mean meat.The menu is seasonal and changes frequently (minus a couple of signature dishes), definitely making the most of the excellent ingredients the Berkshires have to offer. A lot of the meat is butchered in house and, even as suspicious as I am of the all-locaganic-everything movement and those who subscribe to it, I must concede that you can really taste the difference.  I especially recommend the brick chicken. It may not sound as exciting or quirky as some of the other menu options, but it really should not be missed. The skin is so crispy and yet the meat is so juicy that it practically defies the laws of physics with it's deliciousness.The prices are high (especially for drinks) but here, perhaps even moreso than in Mainland Brooklyn, you get what you paid for. Waitstaff is usually highly knowledgeable and will explain anything on the menu to the culinarily confused (and only rarely with the too-cool-for you attitude that is all too common in places like this [*cough cough* looking at you, Rubi's]) I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about food, but I almost always learn or try something knew here! My go-to choice for date night in GB. Also, like any good hipsters, they serve excellent brunch, which is particularly good if you're trying to avoid emptying your bank account.",5.0,1
My wife and I stopped in the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. The place was very busy as expected.  We were told there was an hour wait for seating so we decided just to have a beer at the bar and try elsewhere.  We were lucky enough to get a stool at the bar. The live music was good as was the beer selection.  Staff were all very friendly despite the fact they were very busy.  We were having fun so we changed our minds and had the hostess add us to the wait list.  We had a table in well under an hour. Our server was great as was the food. A bit pricey but we will definitely be back.,4.0,1

"Stopped here on a whim, and it was well worth it. Late brunch on a Saturday. The coffee was amazing, fresh brewed and from a local toaster. Had the sweet potatoes hash and was 10x better than I expected and everything you could possibly ask for at a farm to table restaurant . Perfectly blended flavors, freshest and perfectly cooked eggs, grilled soft cheese bites, tender greens and a touch of pickled vegetables to break up the heaviness of a potato plate. Amazing and satisfying at so many levels. Friend had the pancakes with brown butter apples and they were very happy. Would definitely try dinner here next time. Atmosphere was great, well curated/updated house restaurant blend of historic and hip. Service was lovely, no complaints at all. I only wish there was one more vegetarian option on the menu.",5.0,1

"Prairie Whale, I used to love you but it's (almost) all over now. I came to this realization when we got home and I was still hungry, after spending a decent amount of money on dinner at PW. Sure, the food is good, and the service is friendly, but I just hate it when restaurants get so successful that they decide to take items off the dinner plate and charge for them as sides. I ordered a ragout-like pork dish that the bartender said came with spaetzle, but alas it did not. My companion's fish dish was good, he said, but again...not much on the plate and lacking what they used to call the starch -- just the fish and a small amount of veggies. When I asked the waitress how come I had no spaetzle, she said oh it doesn't come that way and promised to comp us our desserts. Bill came, no comp. Dessert portions were small btw. Sorry, Prairie Whale, you're no longer our favorite restaurant in Great Barrington.",2.0,0

"It was my father's birthday and he wanted to go for brunch, so we went.  It was nice to have on site parking.  Our group of 6 stood in the doorway for a bit before being seated.  We waited a bit before our server arrived for our drink order.  Fortunately, we had Andreas, who had a lot of personality, as our server. (For the record, he did not give his name, we heard it from someone else.)Drinks came in reasonable time, and our orders were taken.  I say write the order down, because you will inevitably screw it up somehow and if you were a fucking genius, you'd be working for NASA...just sayin'.  Our guy had a masters degree, but he still put cheese on my son's burger....and my son was adamant that the burger be plain.  Write it down, already.So, foodwise, I had fried chicken, kale and cornbread....it was really good.  Especially the cornbread...rich and delicious...and small...damn.  Chicken maybe needed a touch more seasoning, but really good.  Son liked the burger once the offending cheese was removed, daughter said burger was like sliced meatloaf.  My Mom liked the Caesar ok, husband liked his egged and kielbasa, but the kielbasa piece was very small.  My father ate every bite, so he seemed happy.  Son and Grandad had dessert, apple pudding and not a bite left, so apparently good.Would have loved if the fireplaces were lit...as it was cold and damp.  Pretty good size bill for brunch $173 for 6, but with booze, which a $13 bottle retail is $40.Did I love it enough to travel to go back?  Not sure.  Make us feel welcome from the get-go and then give us a satisfying meal, with enough on the plate and we'll be happy to pony up the dough.",3.0,0
"Prairie Whale manages to be serious about creating delicious and creative food and drinks, while maintaining an inviting and comfortable environment that makes you never want to leave. All of the inside and outside are delightful, but the bar is the best place to hang for the night. The bartenders are highly skilled and very friendly. On my recent visit I had a wonderful, clean gin cocktail that had a nasturtium leaf floating in it to look like a lily pad. The beer list features a nice selection of MA breweries and beers you don't see on every menu. On my most recent visit my partner and I shared the smoked chicken wings, pig head rillettes, broccoli tagliettelle, and coconut pudding.

Pros: solid food - I got the burger and my boyfriend got the fried chicken dish. The best thing he said about it was the jalapeño butter and the collard greens. The chicken wasn't all that substantial in portion size. The draft beer selection is good and the cabin fever cocktail was tasty and original.Cons: service was slow. The waitress we had was nice but took her sweet time and was not very knowledgable. We waited a long time to get her attention and the check never seemed to come until we were able to make eye contact. Indifferent: Atmosphere looked promising when we walked in but we soon realized that we were just hanging out in a porch like structure during the entire dinner. When night fell the experience got more intimate with the candles lit and lights glowing but in general we were left pretty indifferent due to poor service.,3.0,0
"The hipster farm to table persona aside, Prairie whale does well to stand up as a very complete restaurant experience. The interior is in line with the farm feel, the contemporary locavore and recycled style. Wait staff are brief but attentive, the restaurant was well staffed for a busy Saturday evening. Starting out with local brews on tap, a bit of a wait was of no concern.The menu is simple and focuses on seasonal dishes, diverse ingredients, and recognizable dishes. The fried chicken is superb and is perhaps eclipsed only by the outstanding cornbread it was served with, maple and with a moist crumb coarser than usual. The rotating menu has certain staples, each in a portion not to large but enough to stand on its own. My brick chicken was generous, two full thigh-leg portions in a wonderfully simple jus.While the prices may be high, the quality and competition don't make that surprising. The atmosphere, accessible enough to bring the kids and social for a night out with friends, pressure whale is outstanding all around. Lower prices and faster service would make due an unstoppable Berkshire spot.",5.0,1

"A level above pub food but the selections were hit or miss, mostly miss. The burger was ordered ""medium"" and came so pink it was nearly mooing. The fried chicken was fine but, as another patron noted, a bit too greasy. The brick chicken was swimming in a brown liquid. The corn bread was tasty. As far as drinks, they don't have much in the way of top shelf liquor (no Ketel One or Grey Goose) and the Martinis were warm. The Aperol Spritz appears to have been made with Aperol and Club Soda only -- no Prosecco. The server was pretty terrible. I would have ordered another drink, but we were never asked about another round. My favorite part is when we all ordered coffee and she told us that coffee would take ""7 or 8 more minutes, did we still want it?"" We did. Miraculously it appeared one minute after that along with her saying ""I swear it's fresh!"" That should be the motto for the restaurant: ""Prairie Whale: I swear it's fresh!"" But she served the coffee with no sweetener, a carafe with about 2 tablespoons of milk, and no spoons. Considering there were no dinner utensils left on the cleared table I guess we could all just go use our fingers to stir the coffee or maybe just get out? Was that the idea?  I'm not sure why she was in such a hurry to scurry us along when there were tables there still eating dinner. Regardless, she was bad news.",3.0,0

"If the owners are reading: Get it together with your wait staff! Went in at 6 pm on a Friday to beat the dinner rush and ended up waiting to be seated for nearly 10 minutes while staring at empty tables, because the hostess was gabbing with a server. We asked out server about he portion size of the vegetable plate. She wasn't sure so she asked the hostess. The hostess look baffled and then said,""I don't know how much you eat!"" And she said it in an irritated tone. To begin with it was rude, but really? KNOW YOUR BUSINESS. Heck? Make something up. Nobody will sue you if you're wrong - people just want to know how much to order. Don't be a jerk about it. Frankly? The food was fantastic (if at times very much like Nudel), but of the service doesn't improve I won't be back more than a few times, which is too bad. The venue is great. The drinks were great.

"Our brunch food was solid... But the service was appalling.It took forever to get anyone to even acknowledge that we had walked in the door. The staff were all too busy socializing in the TV room or at the bar with their pals. We stood around asking ""is anybody here""? for a good five minutes, then finally were seated near an open door in winter--featuring an arctic breeze. (Our waiter was ostensibly bringing in firewood, but kept getting distracted by friends whom he simply *had* to hug.)Repeated requests for a menu were ignored/forgotten. I myself forgot to bring the giant protest sign which is apparently necessary to get a waiter to return to your table so you can ask for more coffee. I've waited tables in the Berkshires, so I sympathize with staff. But your job is not to socialize with your friends. It's to pay attention to customers. It felt like this was a members-only club: if you hadn't spent the day before skiing with the owner, you were not important enough to be waited on.Again, a shame as the menu was appealing and the food quite good, once it arrived.",2.0,0
"Selection of food is somewhat limited. And no specials as we requested. However, what is available is very fresh, clearly making good use of lots of local produce. Portions are not large, don't expect to be taking anything home or sharing much. The brick chicken is very flavorful, but even more yummy and decadent is the fried chicken with a piece of the most delicious cornbread I've ever sampled.",3.0,0
"Unbelievable food. The Berkshires really needed this... exactly this. I went in with my sister and her husband on a cold day. The bartender opened the door a little before official opening to offer us a drink and to stay warm. We sat and enjoyed his company and knowledge of drinks as well as food suggestions for a long while. I did not want to leave! When in season my choices are: kale and squash soup with egg, Coppa or the best cornbread you will ever have.Thank you for the nice evening, I will be back!",5.0,1
"My wife and I had lunch there today with no trouble getting seated.  The owner brought our menus and we had a nice conversation about the NYT article and that we had not realized it was a new restaurant despite passing it a number of times in the last few months.  My wife ordered a glass of wine and when he brought it he had another, more full glass also, and explained that the smaller was the last of the one she ordered and the other was the one replacing it on the menu.  This was a very nice gesture.My wife's BLT had the best bacon we have tasted and the whole sandwich was excellent.  My cheeseburger was very good and very meaty tasting, not bland.  The lettuce and tomato were tasty as well. The fries with both our meals were just right.I don't generally like cream pies, but the ""deconstructed"" chocolate cream pie was quite good.  The chocolate was more firm than a cream or mousse and sat on a bed of chocolate crumbs and there was a large dollop of home-made whipped cream.We found the owner to be friendly, attentive and fair.  The waitstaff were professional and attentive.It was an excellent leisurely lunch and we will return.",4.0,1

"We went to the Prairie Whale after a local recommended it for dinner while we were in the Berkshires on vacation recently.The place is adorable, it is basically in an old house. The atmosphere inside is great, there is a nice bar when you first walk in and ample dining space as well. Note that we were here ""off-season"" so it wasn't as crowded as it probably would have been in the summer.We had cocktails from the bar, I stuck with the ""salty dog"" which was vodka with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, a salted rim and fresh rosemary. My boyfriend tried a new cocktail, the Herb(ert) and also the Harvey Whalebanger. He liked both of them, although the Whalebanger was definitely the strongest drink of the three. I loved the salty dog, something wonderful about fresh juice and booze together.We started with an order of the cornbread, YOU MUST TRY THIS. No joke, some of the best cornbread I've ever had in my life, and I'm from the south. So you don't necessarily expect to get great cornbread at a farm to table Yankee establishment.For dinner my boyfriend had the pork chop, which was served with clams out of the shell and Brussels sprouts (which were delicious). I had the skate fish, cooked in a stew of sorts with two scallops and a medley of veggies. The skate was a bit mushy for my taste, it was the last plate of skate they had, and I think it had sat in the stew for too long. But I will say it was the only negative thing that happened while we were there. I should have ordered the brick chicken. Sadness. Next time...For dessert we had the affogato. The ice cream was great, my boyfriend said the espresso was some of the best he ever had, and the biscotti were yummy too.This place has been slammed for service it seems, but our waitress was an absolute delight. She was charming, patient with us while we vacillated over the menu for way too long, and attentive any time we needed anything. She was delightful!So overall, we loved the place, great good, super cute environment to enjoy a meal, really yummy cocktails, and the most important take away, excellent corn bread. Go here for the cornbread if nothing else!!!",4.0,1
"I've only been in here a couple of times. The interior was never really meant for a restaurant, so even if it's not busy there's a bit of congestion. My first experience there it was just for a few drinks with friends. When I asked the bartender for a Jim Beam and Coke, he said he didn't have Jim Beam and asked if I wanted something that was actually good instead. I'm not necessarily a proud man, and he seemed to realize he misspoke, so I brushed it off. On my next visit there, it was too busy for me to want to stay. My mother has testified to the quality of the food, to which I don't doubt, but I can't see myself returning of my own planning.",3.0,0
"Overpriced, uninspired, and uncomfortable.  There are many wonderful restaurants in Great Barrington that hit the mark on atmosphere, food quality, service and value.  This one doesn't. We arrived at noon on a deep winter Sunday morning hoping for lunch but settled for the brunch menu which is what was offered.  There were 7 or 8 entrees listed, all but one involving serious meat, so very limited options for a vegetarian (which is fine, I get that Prairie Whale means pig and that's not why I'm giving it one star; it's really just a warning for other veggies.)Atmosphere - very pub like, lots of wood, wooden tables, wooden benches, wooden stools, wooden paneling on the walls.  Dark and wooden.  A stark contrast to the light and airy space the building was in a previous life.Service - I've said in previous reviews that I respect how extremely difficult it is to find good, qualified, reliable service staff so I don't rate on that unless the service is especially great or especially mean. In this case, the service was especially mean. The waitress was just cold, unhelpful and indifferent...to us and to those at the neighboring tables.  One of the folks seated next to us wasn't served his bloody mary whilst all the others at his table were.  When he asked the waitress she said, ""the bar is very busy.  It's coming.""  Food - I ended up ordering a kale and bean soup with an egg on top and my husband ordered a pulled pork sandwich, or something like it. My soup was great although extremely salty. Husband said his sandwich was absolutely delicious. But both portions were very small so we both pushed away from the table pretty hungry AFTER paying a $65 check. For brunch. In Great Barrington. For soup and a sandwich. With two non-alcoholic beverages.I won't be back but if you don't mind the big check I think it would be worth it for a carnivore to try the regular lunch or dinner menu mid-week.",1.0,0

"For a place listed as not good for kids, there sure were a lot of kids there at 8pm on the Sunday before Christmas.  We had been to Bell and Anchor once before for brunch.  At that visit, the Bloody Mary was excellent and all the dishes from the polenta and sausage to the salad with pickled eggs.For dinner, it was extremely busy so we sat at the bar.  I enjoy the atmosphere generally, although this evening two patrons sat nearby dropping the f-bomb with startling frequency.  I normally wouldn't mention it, since the restaurant doesn't control the patrons, except one of the staff members was sitting there drinking and chatting with the pair.  So much for setting the tone of the place.We started with a hen consommé with ramen and nori.  The broth was very rich and flavorful.  Then we had the grilled chorizo with polenta.  Also very tasty.  For mains, my wife had the vegetarian plate, which felt sort of skimpily proportioned compared to my dish, and was more like three different items on the plate than a cohesive dish.  I opted for the pork with polenta, bacon and mushrooms.  The pork was nicely braised - flavorful and juicy.  The mushrooms had a rich deep flavor that I couldn't get enough of.  I truly appreciate it when a dish puts just enough of something onto the plate that you long for more but don't feel like you got just one bite.  The bacon was thick cut and more on the chewy side than the crisp side.  I think I would've liked a crisper bite to go with all the soft textures.All in all, I was satisfied with the visit, but I didn't find myself daydreaming of visiting again.",3.0,0
"The fried chicken came piping hot along with to die for cornbread.  It turns out that at least for me, the fried chicken was too greasy.  The chicken was beautifully tender underneath the fried part.  Service was excellent.  I gave it a 4 only because I wasn't overly wowed with the chicken.  The rest of my dining experience was solid.",4.0,1
"Stopped here for dinner this evening after the movies. Five stars might not be enough :)  Everything about it was wonderful. The owner is knowledgeable and so friendly, (good looking too :) the waitstaff was very helpful and the service was excellent. Knew our waitress from another restaurant in town and it was good to see her here - she came to work from the day this place opened. The ingredients are all grown locally - our dinner was really wonderful - chicken under the brick - and dessert was amazing. We are so happy that we stopped here. The movie was great and dinner was even better. I can't wait to come back. It's nice to have another really good restaurant in town.I do not understand why YELP says DRESSY - this is definitely a CASUAL place and the 4 $$$$ signs are very misleading. Prices are good - definitely $$ to $$$ but not $$$$.",5.0,1
"Went here Friday night for dinner, the ambiance and live music were amazing. We were seated at the bar, which we didn't mind, but we were very close to the service bar and had a hard time getting service. We spent a large portion of our night unsuccessfully trying to get the bartender's attention for drink refills, plates for our appetizers, etc. Unfortunately our overall experience was very hindered since were made to feel like such a bother. The food was okay. The mustard greens salad came so overdressed it was hard to eat. The tagliatelle was pretty good.",3.0,0
"Went for dinner with the SO while on vacation in the Berkshires. We love Diner in Brooklyn, so we were excited to check it out. Ahhhhhhhhhhh, how precious. The building itself is cute and cozy. The decor is lovely, without being ironic or overdone. The service was very good, and the owner himself was the host on a busy Friday night!The portions were nicely sized, ESPECIALLY the meat servings which were generous. Some things are bit pricer than others, but their are enough options on the menu for everyone. They pride themselves on super fresh and ethical ingredients and it is worth it.Overall, wonderful visit. We've recommended this place to other friends when they have gone on vacation and we will be back next time we are on vacation. Totally idyllic Great Barrington restaurant.",5.0,1
"Been here several times for dinner against my better judgement. The food is tolerable, the service is lousy, and the atmosphere is aggressively pretentious and harkens to a rustic chic that would seem less out of place in Brooklyn six years ago. The food is wildly overpriced for the area, especially the steaks, and it isn't near good enough to justify the expense. Depending on who the bartender is you can get a decent cocktail.",1.0,0
"MAKE A RESERVATION. I REPEAT... DON'T GO WITHOUT ONE. And I don't recommend this place if you have an allergy (like I do) I went in a few minutes after they opened and asked to sit outside (many open tables inside and out- maybe 1/5 of the tables total were seated in and out) I was told those are saved for bigger parties ... (what?! It was just me btw) so she said seat yourself (Inside and waved towards bar) I asked for a table (I hate bar stools... and have lymphedema so high stools are not comfortable) But she basically COULDN'T give me a table because I was one person... despite so many open ones... so I said I'd sit at the bar after me standing there for a minute while she ""tried to figure out"" where to seat me... Once seated at the bar... I overhead the wait staff behind the bar talking about an allergy a customer outside had and one said to another that she had served them before and they wouldn't die if it's cross contaminated. WTF. so I immediately said I will die if you give me nuts (because we'll epipen) and she said okay let's put your food in right away so it's not cross contaminated  (WHAT!? you don't say that!!! I've literally never been told that!) I made sure it wouldn't be a problem before I ordered and was recommended a few basic dishes but went with the one vegetarian option because I don't eat a lot of meat.Listen ... an allergy is an allergy ... death or swelling.. it all SUCKS! don't contaminate the food if someone took the time to let you know. Overall... wait staff is super friendly and you can tell there are a lot of regulars here... food is beyond amazing... the flavor and combination of the chick pea dish was FABULOUS but my overall experience was sub par.. and I will not be returning because of poor customer service and general attitude of allergen practices.",3.0,0
"There wasn't anything wrong with this place so I can't give it anything below a 5. Came from NJ to explore the Berkshires - SO happy we stopped in GB because this place was INSANE. Menu was amazing - food was amazing - got the pork sammy, fried chicken, the burger - would recommend them all again. Got the cheese/fruit plate in the beginning (I know it sounds basic) but it was actually really f'in good and unique. Drinks were also awesome and unique, service was awesome. We even lucked out with outlets next to our table to charge our dead AF phones from traveling. Would love to go back again!",5.0,1
"Ate at B&A this evening. Perfect weather to sit outside and play some ping pong. Elizabeth was our server, and was excellent. She even brought over an extra paddle so both kids could play ping pong.

The chicken was moist and delicious, and the accompanying corn bread was out of this world. Love this place!",4.0,1
"Went to Bell and Anchor again this evening (7/5). It did not disappoint. The service was great, and I ended up speaking with the owner, Mark, for a few minutes; he couldn't have been more hospitable. The only minor misstep (very minor) was turned into a positive when, after ordering 2 caiperna's in rocks glasses that were delivered in collins glasses, the drinks were taken back and Mark delivered the drinks in rocks glasses, as well as the leftovers from the collins glasses (no waste here!) Apps Ordered: Caesar salad (very good); house-made coppa (very good); beet salad (very good); fried pig's cheek with shaved celery, hot sauce, and ranch (AMAZING!). Bell and Anchor does an amazing job with pig; if they are serving pig's tail, cheek, etc. definitely order it!Entrees Ordered: cheeseburgers (great; fries were perfect); brick chicken (really great - while roasted, the skin was so crispy that this dish was somewhere between roasted and fried - delicious); cranberry beans (earthy and delicious). Th kids again played on the lawn with others while we dined outside on the patio. Can't wait to return!",4.0,1
"This is quite possibly the best new restaurant in the Berkshires in years (food as good as Rouge). We went this evening for dinner (4 adults and 3 small kids). It was a perfect night weather-wise and, while we sat outside, the kids were able to run around the property, play ping pong, etc. without any problem. The service was very good, but the food was stellar. We had:Apps: house made coppa; nappa cabbage salad; crostini with garlic scapes; and fried pig's tail with hot sauce. All were delicious. Entrees: brisket; pork sandwich; and leg of lamb. Again, everything was wonderfully prepared and perfectly cooked. Dessert: brown butter rhubarb tart. This was the weakest part of the meal, but still ok. Drink selection was also great (especially the ""perfect storm"" cocktail). Contrary to the typical Berkshires dinner crowd, which tends to skew a bit older, the crowd was younger and many had young children in tow. This was no issue, however, as the kids were able to run around the property while the adult diners got to enjoy. We made another reservation to come back in 2 weeks. The owner, Mark, has truly done a great service to the Berkshires dining scene!",4.0,1

"We ate at this old tavern for dinner while vacationing. The dimly lit dining room had ambiance, but as it got dark outside, I could barely see my food that was being lit by a single candle. Had the fries, cornbread, and charcuterie appetizers. Very salty but good fries, cornbread wasn't warm. Charcuterie was tasty..pate, rillett, cured meat on toast points. My wife had a dry pork tenderloin with tasty spatzle, red cabbage, and mushrooms. I had the fried chicken..very small and salty leg and thigh with a very bitter mustard green salad. The apple almond bread pudding was good..the pana cotta ok. Quite expensive.",2.0,0

Nice French wine selection and despite what I read from others, wait staff prompt and very pleasant.

I ended up ordering the meatball appetizer and was not disappointed.   My only gripe was that it was extremely warm in the dining area.  They should figure out how to open a window or two when needed.  Overall, an excellent meal and I would highly recommend.",4.0,1

"Don't believe the hype. We eagerly dined at the prairie Whale, arriving early to avoid the crowds, but it was already crowded; a great sign of what's to come, the food was going to be phenomenal, we thought. We thought wrong. I had a salad drenched in so much dressing it was soggy and it was so salty I could not finish it. It is honestly rare for me not to finish my food, especially a salad, but this was inedible. And I found the service weird, like they were doing us a favor by letting us eat there. My main course was also extremely salty, I love salt, i salt my food, this was ridiculous. It just wasn't good food. The prairie whale is a big prairie fail for me. The stars are for the atmosphere and look of the place only.",2.0,0

"Loved Prairie Whale. Went for brunch on a Saturday and wasn't disappointed. There was no wait for a table of six. The menu indicates the meats are all local and that they raise their own pigs! I had the smoked pork sandwich and - yes - it was excellent. The pork was thinly sliced but tender, juicy and flavorful. Loved it. It came on a brioche bun with some good crunchy slaw inside to balance the pork's saltiness. A friend also ordered the buttermilk pancakes which were huge and fluffy and delicious. We also ordered a freshly baked scone with butter that was terrific. The outside has a light crunch and the inside is fluffy. Brilliant. The cask beer that I had wasn't great - I just don't think my thing is cask beer. There are several other beers, wines and whiskeys to choose from as well as cocktails. The fries weren't anything special - but I ate them all the same.",4.0,1
"Oh, hello Prairie Whale, you fantastic gem. While in Great Barrington for business, I stopped by Prairie Whale for dinner with a group of four and had a really wonderful experience. First, when you pull up to Prairie Whale, it appears as though you're going into someone's house for dinner. It was a beautiful night and we had no problem being seated outside on their very adorable patio space. The inside of the restaurant is beautiful as well, with fresh flowers and other accessories adorning the entire space. Outside, our server came over quickly and took our drink order. I went with their version of a Tom Collins and my colleagues went with a drink that included Mezcal. We all loved them, super refreshing. To share, we started with the chicharones and their homemade hot sauce, oysters, and a goat cheese crostini dish. All were so delicious! The appetizers were perfect to share between four people, highly recommend starting your meal this way. For dinner, I went with the brick chicken. I almost never order chicken out, but our server let us know chicken is their specialty. I did not regret my decision. Juicy and moist, this chicken was cooked perfectly with tasty skin on the outside. My dining companions had the halibut, sausage, and pork chop. I had some of the pork chop and it totally rocked. A must-order was also the cornbread. It's got grill marks on the side and a great sweet/savory combo going on. We couldn't get enough.Overall, Prairie Whale was by far the best meal I had in Great Barrington. It's certainly not cheap, but you're receiving quality dishes made from quality ingredients. Prices are comparable for other farm to table experiences. We also heard the owners use the animals from their own farm which is super cool. Definitely stop by if you're in the area!",5.0,1

He said the cucumber soup was fantastic, but the burger he ordered ""medium"" was nearly raw and I noticed he didn't eat a lot of it. My ""Brick Chicken,"" supposed to be a long-cooked affair and therefore falling apart tender, was so tough and SALTY I could barely eat it. Came with a mush of overcooked dandelion greens. And did I say SALTY? Same with the overdressed salad We waited so long to get the check (or dessert) that I had to go find the server and ask her to bring it to us. We topped off the dinner with ice cream at SoCo, which was excellent. My tip, if you want great chicken, is the Co-op. And a tenth of the price.",1.0,0
"I keep wanting to love the Prairie Whale, but despite a couple of good brunches, I have to reduce stars. The atmosphere in winter, the fire, the congeniality is delightful, if only the food measured up! Yesterday I ordered goulash, which was quality-wise only medium--gnarly, chewy meat and not particularly inspiring sauce. The menu advertised it came with ""Brussels sprouts"", which turned out to be not a vegetable portion, but a sprinkling of leaves for garnish. I hate that! If it's a garnish, say it's a garnish and at the very least, at $24, offer a vegetable with your entree. To make up for it, I ordered an arugula salad at $11, which turned out to be mush.That, and a bottle of sparking water at $7 added up to $50 with tip. I don't mind spending money, but not on a pedestrian meal! Arggh!",2.0,0
"I'm with Ken D., will keep the options open because I WANT this to be my favorite restaurant. I love the vibe, the people, the fact that finally, as Larry R. says, it feels like a restaurant of today in a town that time forgot when it comes to restaurants. However it left me with many wishes: lower prices, more variables on the menu (the night I went it was chicken, duck & beef, no seafood or lamb), more VEGETABLES (not just the starchy ones -- how about a salad selection?), and listing the sides that come with an entree on the menu. I ended up with the burger by default (didn't feel like chicken, and the short ribs came with chick peas, which don't  count as a ""vegetable"" in my book) -- and my burger was just okay, not the best in the area (that award goes to The Brick House). So I will give them credit for trying and hope they work out the kinks so they can be the hang-out  place our very discerning locals have been waiting for....Summer update...it was great to sit outside but otherwise the experience was not any better, unfortunately. I ordered a feta salad for $10 that was miniscule. My friend got the pork neck, which was pretty dried up, and yielded about 2 ounces of meat. He said his salad was limp. Again, I WANT to like this place, but it's just not ringing my bell.SPRING UPDATE: Had a great brunch here, one of the best ever. And great service. If this keeps up, I'll be a regular.",3.0,0

We got our two entrees at different times, which was fine because we share, but might have been awkward for others. Overall a lovely and memorable dinner!",5.0,1
"This restaurant was recommended by the receptionist at our Hotel.  Our wait service was fast and attentive.  The $26 Brick Chicken was bland, greasy and over salted.

"Really cute place. We came here for brunch and loved the place. It felt like we were eating in an old colonial house. The brunch menu looked good.

The whitefish had the potential to be great- but the toast seemed as if it had been sitting out for a bit and lost its crunch. I would have preferred it to be warmer. My husband liked the burger and fries as well. The service was good, music was great and the vibe was awesome. They also have an outdoor seating area and a grassy area for children to run as well.

"Do not go to this restaurant if you have any dietary restrictions, allergies, sensitivities, or food likes/dislikes.  This was the most independent unaccommodating restaurant I've ever been to,  and I eat in the top NYC restaurants.  They switched a beef dish for a pork dish on the menu and refused to give me the side starch that went with the original dish unless I ordered the pork (which I can't eat)  So I asked for the hamburger with extra cheese, they refused to give me extra cheese. So I ordered the steak, medium since the nasty rude waitress was giving me attitude rushing me to order.  Within less than 2 minutes, I asked her if I could have the burger the way it comes, and she told me no because the steak was $42, and it was already on the grill.  Which was clearly a lie because I ordered it medium and we hadn't even gotten appetizers yet.  I said but I only ordered it 2 minutes ago there's no way it's already on the grill, and she threw her hands up at me and rolled her eyes and walked away cursing me under her breath.  The manager came over and agreed to give me the burger but still refused to let us order the spatzel as a side dish because ""they have just enough for the dish it accompanies and can't give any more"" even though it was a half hour before closing and clearly nobody else was sitting down to eat.   They have 2 $$ listed online for price and yet it was over $50 per person. They charged for bread.  The menu called it a baguette which implied a long piece of bread and then charged $4 for one tiny piece of bread.  My 4 year old asked for a scoop of vanilla ice cream and they told him no unless he ordered a full expensive dessert.  I had to argue with them to give him ice cream, which they eventually did with an attitude.  The food was mediocre at best and the service was awful, arrogant and nasty.",1.0,0

"Stopped in on a Sunday night and got seated right away and was excited from the nice atmosphere. My seat was a bit wobbly but I ignored it because that just happens sometimes. After 20 minutes the waitress finally got to us for drink orders. During this time I grew a bit uncomfortable as where we were sitting had the most foot traffic and almost hollow floors.. causing constant vibration and shaking. It took 40 minutes for the waitress to finally place our order for two ribeyes which were ok..not worth $44 each. As for service, we got the bare minimum of getting our order taken and then after sitting finished with our meal, calling her to get the check and boxes. With restaurants that are more on the expensive side, I tend to expect the service to be on part as well. Maybe they were shorthanded, but I got the feeling it was a lack of concern as it wasn't crazy busy and the waitress barely had a smile. Very disappointed.",2.0,0
"We spend a week a summer up in the GB area, and were excited to try somewhere new.  We loved Prairie Whale!  Our family of five got a nice table in the back.  We weren't rushed; the owner made small talk with us and made us feel very welcome; the service was attentive, food delicious. We'll totally go back... and maybe grab some to go to bring to Tanglewood...",4.0,1
"We went here for brunch on Easter for the first time despite being locals for the past few years. I'm sorry to say, I was so disappointed. I was 9 months pregnant and when I asked for my poached eggs to be well cooked, my request was denied. Instead, I ordered an omelette, which was served nearly raw in the middle. I understand not wanting to accommodate lots of special requests but I'm not understanding denying a request out of an obvious medical need. That said, the atmosphere was very nice and the waitstaff was very attentive.",2.0,0

"I heard that several former professional basketball players have frequented Prairie Whale so being one myself I had to try it out. I was not disappointed. I am a farm to table kind of guy since my playing days, and let me tell you this is farm to table. I had the honor of traveling the world playing basketball and there is quite a bit of down time in between practice,PT, and games. I would usually head out in what ever city by myself and search for the ""Jem in the stone"". Well let me tell you I finally found it at Prairie Whale . And the proprietor is such a fun guy .",5.0,1
"Atmosphere was nice even though they are going through some renovations, service was great and the food was amazing! Had a couple beers, whitefish crostini for an appetizer which was very tasty. My husband and i split the pork shank and the fried chicken, both were delicious. The cornbread with the jalapeño butter was so good it was like a savory cupcake and we ate all the butter as if it were frosting! Amazing all the way around :)",5.0,1
"Finally got a chance to try this place on Saturday for a friend's birthday. They gave us the Trophy Room in the back, really cool atmosphere with the trophies on the shelf and historic school athletics photos on the wall. Made it feel like we were all drinking beers and eating in a friends 1970's basement. This place feels very hipster, and there's nothing wrong with that because the food is fantastic. Good beers on tap, good food selection. I kept it simple with the grass fed burger, had a couple of the local craft beers (Big Elm IPA), my wife got the pasta entree and there were no complaints on her end. I can't wait to get back here and try some of the seafood that my friends were getting. The fried chicken looks great as well.",4.0,1

"Pretty heavy comfort food. A lot of salt and fat. But it's delicious if you like that kind of fare. It's not terribly inventive and I find it's often overcooked. I think bar area is the better room, even eating at the bar. However, I always get seated in the small dining room or in-between and it is fairly unlovely (and loud for some). Outside seems cool but again not quite lovely view of the Main Street traffic. Service is up and down. I have never had an issue but last time I was there they seemed overwhelmed and both tables near us experienced problems. Of course, I must admit, those people would experience problems anywhere they go as they seemed fussy and uptight.",3.0,0
"by far, the best gem of our excursion to the Berkshires. eat here. I am always in searchx of local sourced food, but because of it's more recent trend, that term often gets thrown around loosely. we walked in to a dimly lit dining room to a lovely 3-piece mid century jazz band, and I knew I had made the right choice. order the cheesecake. we had the house cured coppa, mustard green pesto over house pasta, and beet salad. the goat cheese cheesecake literally stopped my date in mid sentence. it was definitely not a cheap meal. but it was worth every penny.",5.0,1
"We simply adore this place.  We are there just about weekly, and have not had one bad meal (nor bad service) yet.The menu rotates daily, but there are some greatest hits you should absolutely try.The fried chicken is simply ridiculously wonderful.  We were there last night and they served it with blue cheese grits and mustard greens.  The bartender offered to serve it buffalo style, and frankly, I could eat it forever!  So damn good.The brick chicken is usually on the menu as well, which is just about as perfect a roast chicken as one could get, with a rotation of seasonal veggies served along side.  You will not be disappointed.If cocktails are your thing, you won't be disappointed on that front either.  Our latest favorite is the maple bacon old fashioned.  It goes down dangerously easy, so beware, and enjoy!More in the mod for Brunch?  Their scones. Do yourself a favor, just get a damn scone.  Then write me back saying thank you.  You're welcome.",5.0,1
We had a pleasant experience but would rate the food as fair and the prices a little high for what you got. The ambiance and people watching made it an enjoyable experience.  The bartender was very pleasant and made a great Manhattan.  Sitting outside and watching the kids play the various games added to the pleasant experience.,3.0,0

"I could've just as easily rated this spot 1 star. Went three times. Burger: cold bun, unskilled and unloved temperature/gradient in the meat. Salad: lazily overdressed in a vinaigrette that didn't seem to have been tasted. Pigtail app: overly sauced, lazy. Duck confit: worst of all. Three elements, Duck, greens, polenta. All overly salty. ALL THREE! No bright elements. No contrast. No harmony. The menu is uninspired, the execution is lazy. There's no love in this food. It's just going through the motions.Btw, the new name is extremely displeasing, difficult, and awkward to say. Symbolic of the place overrall. Trying, but not hard enough. Trying, but not quite having the goods to execute. Pwarwie Whalwee: SEEK INSPIRATION!",2.0,0
"Omg the menu looked deceiving ! From the fried chicken which was the crunchiest and moistest fried chicken ever, to the oven brick chicken. The chicken in both dishes were extremely moist . Did I mention the cornbread served on the side with the maple butter . I had to get an extra side order it was so delicious. I think the biggest surprise was the tagliatelle pasta made with chorizio and asparagus. It was made ""in house""  and cooked perfectly Al dente. We shared the pasta dish but found it necessary to order a few more dishes as it was that delicious . The owner Marc Firth was on hand all evening and the waitstaff was so superb and wonderful .  Every item on the menu was a great surprise . I highly recommend this restaurant . Our next stop is their restaurant in Nyc at pier 25 called Grand Banks . An outdoor seafood restaurant on one of the last old schooners . We cannot wait to try it . Thank you Prarie Whale for this delicious dining experience.",5.0,1
"This might have been my favorite thing about my visit to Great Barrington. Sat at the bar and had french press coffee, and oh, a TSB from Glass Bottom brewery. It is brewed with tea, so it counts as tea, so I can have it for breakfast, right? RIGHT! I had some pure awesome braised pigs feet that are braised until the meat comes off, then formed into a patty, then fried. Freaking love, there were lentils and some other things... did I mentioned the braised fried pig meet? Love. Really nice server/bartender that we chatted to about the breweries. Love this place, great vibe. It's on the destination list.",5.0,1
"11/2014 EDIT:  After three visits subsequent to the one that resulted in the review below, it is clear the restaurant has hit it's stride.  Many if not all of my initial issues resolved.  I recommend without hesitation.INITIAL REVIEW from 12/2012.I was excited to hear that Mark Firth opened up a restaurant in Great Barrington, where we spend a lot of time.  We enjoyed his other Brooklyn restaurants, both of which are consistently good.However, we were disappointed by Bell and Anchor during our 12/2012 visit for the reasons below.  Undoubtedly, some of them are purely personal taste and may even be nit-picking but I wanted to list everything and not hold back:- The space where you enter does not flow right.  It felt like we were in a space NEXT to the restaurant, not in it.- The harsh light from the kitchen (visible from some, not all seating) is unpleasant.- The croutons dry and not flavorful.- The hamburger bun far too dense, detracting from the burger.- The burger itself is okay.  It's great to see that they use the Meat Market but it didn't have that terrific wild taste that we enjoyed all summer long from the Meat Market's ground beef, which we feel is it's strength.- Our server knew little about the menu or the ingredients therein.- Overhead lights seriously depressing.  Please more indirect!Obviously, these are varied impressions from one visit, not a final judgement.  Indeed, we want to go back and try it again because it can take time for a restaurant to find it's place.  We hope this is the case with Bell and Anchor.  A place with the food and consistency of Diner or Marlowe and Sons would be terrific in Great Barrington.",4.0,1
"A bit of a hipster feel...old renovated house, low light, funky but cool wood tables, down home bar.   The food is excellent, often sourced locally, so the menu changes.

"dinner recently on a rainy night, place is definitely different, building an old home, interesting but could use a little spiffing up, drinks and menu were different and interesting, we ordered some of their unusual drinks (note a kettle one martini becomes a berkshire ? martini as they do a lot of local sourcing) but the drinks were great, soup was excellent (leek potato egg smoked whitefish?) and the food order lost..........so we sat for a while and then asked,  oooops....but the food did arrive and it was excellent though at the price quantities were smallish, wife had hamachi (had to google it) and i had the pork belly with chorice and spinach bean mix....everything we ate or drank was very good to excellent, so a lot to like here...",4.0,1
"Excellent Food and cocktails! My husband and I started with the caesar salad with escarole- it was super fresh and crunchy. We both had the fried chicken, corn bread, and greens with a maple butter.

Cocktails were awesome!/I had a Manhattan with a twist, orange bitters were added...the bartender recommended... Loved the cocktail! We will definitely go back!!!",4.0,1
"The food was everything the reviews said it would be-delicious. The service was good.  A caution--we went here for our anniversary dinner and it was unbelievably loud.  There was a preservation hall-style jazz band a few feet from us and the space is not that big anyway, so even without a band, if you have a few loud, large parties, forget about having an intimate dinner.  We could not hear a word the other one was saying.  This is not the place to go for an intimate dinner or to talk--unless, I suppose, you call ahead to see if there's a band that night.  It's the place to get some good food and, obviously, see and be seen in Great Barrington.",3.0,0
"We dined at the Prairie Whale upon the recommendation of friends and it did not disappoint. It was a beautiful night and we sat on the porch.

Definitely worth a stop!",5.0,1
"Quaint place to eat with solid food. Stopped in here for brunch Saturday after all the glowing review I saw on Yelp. I ended up getting the sausage and eggs which was served with a bread and tomato salad (panzanella, I think it's called). BF got the seared tuna also on panzanella. We both enjoyed our meals. Portions could stand to be a little bigger, but all in all we were both satiated at the end of our meal.",3.0,0
"I've been trying to get to Prairie Whale for a few months and finally today, the stars were in alignment. Had the most delicious brunch starting with a delicious Mockingbird cocktail of tequila, berry tea and lime with a hint of mint. Ordered a chocolate hazelnut scone which was served with honey clotted cream, fantastic and enough for two of us to share. Main courses were the fried chicken with jalapeño corn bread and field greens, perfectly cooked and crispy. We also had the polenta with a poached egg on top, homemade sausage and arugula which wilted from the warm polenta, sheer perfection. Service was warm and friendly and our dog was welcomed (and thankfully behaved very well) can't wait to return for dinner!",5.0,1

I have been to Bell & Anchor about 6 times now over the last several months and I love it! The servers have gotten it together and now run a pretty tight ship and the food is consistently amazing.

"Very cozy dining room and good food. The lobster bisque app is OK (not as creamy as most bisque) and the fried chicken is great. Comes with a jalapeño biscuit and a side of greens. The owner owns a local farm and buys all produce (that he doesn't grow himself) and meat locally. The night I went he had bought a whole cow and was serving a variety of steaks. Def worth a visit, even if for a drink.",4.0,1
"All-around wonderful experience! Great food. Great service. Great ambience. Definitely will go back if ever in town again. Highly recommend!We had a large array of food including the fried chicken, the halibut, the pork chop and the quail -- all very tasty and good.  For appetizer we had the oysters which were also spectacular. The menu does change as they source local ingredients, but they said the fried chicken was a staple and we definitely recommend.",5.0,1
"This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.  Really.  I am not exaggerating.  THE WORST.   Fortunately, after a couple of hours, my daughter and I can laugh about it.   But we can't find a single good thing to say about this restaurant.  It has horrible - horrible food, loud music and the waitress, who was probably embarrassed to be serving such slop, couldn't be found.  The bar spilled out into the seating area and it was crowded and loud on a Friday night. There were long tables and we were seated with people we didn't know - although there was an empty chair between us.  Nearly $50 in ransom had to be paid to get out.  It was worth double that to leave.  DON'T COME HERE!  The five star reviews must have been written by the owners' family.",1.0,0
"4 for the food and 2 for service. The burger was good but nothing to write home about. Goat cheese omlet was fine but would love to have more veggies in it.

Lastly although you can add bacon to breakfast sandwich you can't the burger... the waitress admitted the kitchen was weird. And I wish I hadn't gone to the extra effort, the bacon was the saltiest I ever tasted.",2.0,0
Terrible pulled pork sandwich. Please do not order it. I had to send it back: full of gristle and fat. Not much meat. The worst sandwich I've had in years. At least they did give me a cheeseburger as a replacement. My wife liked her sausage with poached eggs and polenta.,2.0,0

"Prairie Whale (you'll need to look that up to see what it means) was a very good surprise.  We were looking to eat outdoors and came across this somewhat non-descript house on the main road (Rt 7) just north of the center of town.  The inside of the main house has a nice old look.  The front lawn is populated with bean bag toss games, ping pong and other fun stuff.  A lot of thirty-somethings and their kids mixed with non-kid groups.  An interesting mix that worked.  The kids did not disrupt the meals and made it a fun experience.  Thank you parents.  The inside bar was a modern rustic mix and the seating looked nice.  We sat outside.  All of our food selections were very good.  When I passed by again recently, I saw the same scene on the front lawn and smiled.",4.0,1

"My first review, I think this maybe beneficial.  So on first enterance the place was VERY busy ( good for them) the lack of a host station of any type was confusing ( I stood and watched 13 people leave in total because they were not being spoken to- seems risky business)   the hostess that had taken our name did check back a few times however wandered around looking for people looking extremely frantic to me.the menu was interesting, however my girlfriend was excited to try the Arctic Char dish and wasnt told it was sold out until she ordered it.  The menu had great local flare, and is pretty spot on for the ambience they are recreating ( foodie/hipster) however I thought the beer list for being that type of place was sad to say the least- seemed more like a large hotels attempt at good beer.  Wine selections we decent- nothing to get excited about.  I opted for the signature grass fed beef burger- although I asked for Medium and got it close to well- if was good- however the french fries were an extreme disappoinment obviously not cooked properly and served some near raw and soggy. We will go again for sure, maybe when they work out some kinks- the grilled sardines were interesting enough as an app.  I hope they look to invest in some different plates and service wares too- the entree plates were of rather lame look and quality.",2.0,0
Finally made it for lunch when we were up this past weekend and the food was delicious. We're big fans of the Brooklyn restaurants and this one is just as good. So nice to have this in GB which has been in MAJOR need of quality food for years (the excellent Rubi's being the exception). Only one minor complaint about wait staff not taking a drink order or asking if we wanted dessert but that's very minor and he was the only one in the restaurant with a few tables to deal with. Very excited to go back for dinner.,4.0,1

From the green garlic soup to the brick chicken, from the kale pesto to the halibut with eggplant puree -- nothing disappointed.  The caesar alone is worth the trip.

"We have been meaning to try this restaurant since it opened and finally last night we managed to get there for dinner.The ambience is great and the bar and dining room are pretty neat. The food however left a lot to be desired and the $$ rating on Yelp is simply incorrect.The wait staff barely knows enough about the food to describe it or offer any recommendations, but, they are very pleasant and friendly.To start with, we ordered the Corn-bread (that everyone seems to rave about) and the grilled cabbage which did not disappoint. These were the best part of the meal.I also ordered a glass of white wine - a small glass for $10 which was mediocre.For our main course, my daughter ordered the cheeseburger which was excellent, my son ordered the braised rabbit which was meh, my wife ordered the quinoa with beets and goat cheese which was ok. I ordered the seared tuna medium rare (or as rare as the chef can serve it) and it was cooked through and through !If you like restaurants for the ambience or coolness, this is definitely a go to place. If you care more about the food, there are plenty other places to choose from in the area.",2.0,0
"Prairie Whale fails to deliver on an enticing promise. The restaurant was uncomfortably warm, the waitstaff was having an off-night and the food was hit-or-miss.

The ambience of the restaurant was good (minus the temperature). Would give it another chance as there is a lot of promise.",2.0,0

Overall I would dine here again, but it would be higher in my list if the interior was freshened up and the portions a bit more generous.",4.0,1
"Visited here a few weeks ago on date night with my husband.  We had heard a few good things so thought we'd try it out.  In all, a great experience.  We were greeted quickly and politely and given our choice of table.  One strange thing we noticed was that the person who took our drink order, dinner order, brought our drinks, and brought our dinner to the table were all different.  We inquired and apparently all of the staff pool tips so whenever there's something to be done, whoever is available jumps in.  It was a bit confusing at first, but overall, service was very good so I guess it works.For dinner I had the fried chicken and cornbread, and my husband had the pork loin.  My chicken was great - super crispy crust, and the cornbread was AMAZING. My husband ate every speck of food on his plate and said if it was socially acceptable, he would have picked up his plate and licked it clean.  One other good thing - the drinks were large.  My wine glass was very full, and they use large glasses in general for their mixed drinks.  We're looking forward to our next trip there.",4.0,1
After hearing great things about the Bell and Anchor we went. DELICIOUS. Loved the ambience. Cozy. Fresh. Homey but cool. The service was swift. Food was simple and perfectly cooked. True comfort food. There was a great energy inside and the restaurant was packed with a range of ages. Finally a restaurant that doesn't cater only to the tourist trade. It will be an instant local hangout I am sure. The owner Mark could not have been more gracious as was our waitress who was fun and knowledgeable about the food and the wine. Yippeee for the Bell and Anchor.,5.0,1
"We ate there on a Wednesday, around 8:00.  Service was good until the wait person spilled my dad's entire meal straight into his lap, cheeseburger, ketchup, fries, et al.  They made him another meal but the damage was serious to his expensive trousers.  They didn't offer anything in return by way of good will.  I think they should have offered a free meal, a dessert, a cocktail and an offer to pick up the dry cleaning bill.  a call into the owner came to nothing.  I think that is just rude.  On another note, there was poor outside lighting, no air conditioning and the bugs were really horrific.  Some citronella torches or candles are in order if not spraying the outside areas.  This restaurant still needs some serious changes to live up up to the hype.",3.0,0

"Terrible brunch experience here. We walked in a little after twelve and were one of the first tables to be seated. But somehow, our food took over an hour be ready despite tables coming in after us being served first. There were some excuses offered by the staff that the kitchen got slammed but I also think our waitress screwed up in coursing the food into ""easy"" and ""complex"" preparations without us indicating that's what we wanted. She also tried to blame it on the complexity of the dishes we orders - ie the pork sandwich and the polenta. I don't appreciate the passive aggressiveness of implying that it's our fault. Additionally the table next to us ordered pork sandwiches and were sat after us but served food first and were out quicker than us. Also if these dishes do in fact take longer, set better expectations about the wait time. Terrible experience made worse by having impatient small children at our table. Despite the food being good I cannot recommend this place. Get your act together!!! If I could give zero stars I would.",1.0,0
"Went to try the restaurant that does not have a sign up yet ! Nobody to greet customers but finally found our way to a table . The wine list by the glass was very limited and not exciting. i liked the ""woodsy"" decor but not thrilled by the staff or the menu. Decided on the fish and chips because the side dish with the meats did not appeal to us. I LOVE vegetables but was not tempted by the quinoa or the squash. Our fish was good despite a very salty tartar sauce. It was a bit of a challenge to have bread et the table and the waiters did not really seem to know how anything was cooked. We were told it was cooked 'normal"". How strange !The chocolate tart was dry and chalky and the galette passable. Could have used a touch of sugar though.All around the new trendy place in town for the "" foodies"" did not do much for us!",2.0,0
"We went here for lunch on Saturday. We had a reservation because we had 7 people. While they had a table ready for us and took our order quickly, the menu was limited to brunch items. We dealt with that, our bad for not checking it before we went. The problem was that we arrived at 12:45 and ordered before 1 and didn't get our food until almost 2. The 2 children in the group were starving. Even the scones we ordered to ride them over took 30 minutes to come. The waitress gave us a hasty ""sorry, the kitchen is backed up"" when after 45 minutes we asked where our food was. No other apology and no one even offered us some bread. I would never go back. While the fried chicken was apparently good, the other items were just fine. Sadly, the best thing we ate was the scone.",2.0,0

It was fresh, subtle and beautifully prepared.  I had the scallops with napa cabbage and roasted potatoes while my partner had the brick chicken (delicious!).  For dessert, we shared two:  the chocolate cream pie and the banana rhubarb (!!) cake with vanilla ice cream topped with candied orange.  Really unique.  Highly recommended!",5.0,1
"We wandered in on a cold winter Friday night after a few days of a family ski trip to Butternut - a couple from Brooklyn in search of something nice involving bourbon and a good dinner.  We were greeted in the busy bar area by the owner himself, grabbed seats at the bar, and were so charmed by the bartenders and the relaxed scene that we ate dinner there - not only that night, but the following night.  The second night, we were shocked when the owner greeted us by name.  The drinks were terrific, the food was delicious, and the hospitality - friendly in just the right way - was memorable.  We will definitely be back.",5.0,1
"Wonderful locavore restaurant.  The owner and farmer, Mark, is happy and proud to chat with you about the menu items grown and produced on his nearby farm.  We felt very well attended to for a special anniversary dinner.  Prices are reasonable for the fresh, delicious and interesting dishes.  Fun atmosphere inside, and it's lovely to sit outside, though I think this place will benefit from some landscaping - high bushes or a trellis or fence perhaps - to separate the seating area from Main Street.",5.0,1
"Lovely place. We tried to get there early but there was already a wait for tables. They let us eat at the bar even though one of us was slightly under age (19). The bar staff was very nice and friendly. It took a little while between ordering and being served but with the number of people in there it was understandable. I was a little bummed that when I asked for my burger to be made thinner (like half the size) they said they were preformed and could not be modified. Medium was more like medium-rare but tasted great. Everyone in my party loved their food. By the time we went to leave the place was packed with locals having drinks. Great place, wold go again.",4.0,1

"Arrived on a Sunday at 7:15 -- without reservations -- in the middle of summer.  Had about a 15 minute wait (less than the expected 25 minutes).  The drinks, food and service were fabulous.  I was ready to be disappointed by the service based on some reviews but we were treated kindly and well and relatively quickly.  The escarole caesar salad was fantastic -- as was the coppa.  Our entrees which ranged from cheeseburger to striped bass were fresh and delicious - complex fresh flavors.  It is more laid back than Jonathan Andrews, which was welcome, and the food just as delicious (but refreshingly different).  We dined with my parents (in their 70s) and my son (8.5) and all were pleased.  They treat children very kindly.  We will definitely be back.",5.0,1
"After spending a beautiful day with my friend from Bklyn we decided to try this place in Great Barrington. I have tried the owner's other restaurants in Bklyn - Roman's, Marlowe and Sons, Diner and enjoyed them all so I was excited to try this place in the Berkshires. The room is beautiful, the atmosphere inviting and warm and we sat at the bar and ordered the Brick Chicken and the scallops. I highly recommend the Brick Chicken - it is a big portion and absolutely delicious and succulent - it comes with Kale and Polenta. The scallops were very tasty as well but the portion was a little small. But it was perfect for me. Delicious cocktails, nice bartenders - a really classy and fun addition to Great Barrington - I""m so glad it's here!!!",4.0,1
"We had a wonderful experience at Prairie Whale last night. As suggested our party of 4 arrived at 6:30  ( no reservations accepted for parties of 6 or less) and were seated within 5 minutes by the owner in a cozy room in front. The service was great - ordered cocktails and then our food.  When our main courses came out, we were missing an entree. When asked about it, the waitress immediately apologized, explained the mistake and said the pork chop was now on the grill and would be right out. The owner also came over to apologize and said we would not be charged. Talk about customer service!! And equally as important the food was outstanding. We had the tomatillo chicken soup for an appetizer and both women had the brick chicken and both men had the pork chops. Both dishes were finger licking good, literally. We will be back.",5.0,1
"Came here for brunch after ice fishing. Fried chicken was the best I had! The breading had a tint of maple syrup sweetness too it which made me want to finish every last crumb on my plate (a thigh and a leg--good size for me). It came with green collards also seasoned with a dap of maple syrup which was good. And corn bread with, you guessed it, maple butter. Maple syrup overload? Nope. It was wasn't like pouring maple syrup on pancakes, it was flavored lightly with maple syrup which rounded everything together. My bf had the corn beef with eggs. He said it was delish but like other ppl said, the corn beef slice is kinda small. Would come back again.",4.0,1
"Definitely worth a return visit, which from us is a high compliment. We got there after nine and were seated immediately although the place was still quite busy. We shared a salad of chicory, feta, etc. Quite well done. Our mains were Brick Chicken (exceptional) and pork chop (above average). Prairie Chicken has to be among the best in the Great Barrington area. Don't miss it.",4.0,1
"Personally, I am soooooo happy someone young and fun has opened a restaurant here.  I moved up here a year ago and love the town and the Berkshires are beautiful but I have struggled mightily to find someplace that does not cater to the over 65 crowd. The simple, fresh food, prices, outdoor seating, ping pong table on the lawn as well as the fireplaces in winter really won me over. Thank you for bringing a bit of style to this place!",5.0,1
"tried to eat here.  Nice interior, friendly host but only one quinoa dish for vegetarians.  Again, no problem-it's their prerogative.  But please do not say we are a ""farm to table restaurant"" as a way of condescendingly explaining the lack of vegetables.  Last time I checked farms have plenty",1.0,0
"Had a pork sandwich which was pork with jalapeno jam, mustard and rye bread. It came with fries. the bread didnt get soggy and the sauce that as absorbed into the bread only added flavor.

"Went here last night upon a friends recommendation. When I learned it was a Mark Firth restaurant I was sold. I love his spots in Brooklyn.  When we arrived my boyfriend said that he like the decor and it had a warm atmosphere. It was just before 7pm which is when the place really fills up. We gave our name to Joni (host/woman in fabulous glasses) and caught a spot at the bar. The wine by a glass menu is a bit lacking (no Cab?) and other patrons complained that the actual wine glasses were too small. We didn't feel rushed but really wanted some back support at an actual table. Trying to make a movie nearby we ordered food at the bar. Before our mains came out we were transferred  to a table.  We were checked in on by what seemed the entire waitstaff, which made us feel like family. We split the beer &onion soup and crostini with ricotta and beets. Both were great, fresh and filling. The soup was the winner. We then split the burger which was on the small side (the patty)  but well flavored. The owner Mark came over to our table offering us free dessert because we had to wait a bit for a table. We were surprised and delighted. The desserts- a cardamom custard and chocolate bread pudding were delicious and perfect for sharing. When we left we waived goodbye to everyone like old friends. We will return!",4.0,1
"A nice place to have lunch & most likely dinner based on lunch.  We read the review in NYT recently & coincidentally took a day trip over to Great Barrington today and thought what better time than the present to try B & A. We ate outside & ended up having not only a wonderful lunch but made some unexpected friends with some of the other patrons. The fried green tomato sandwich was my end to summer - & it did not disappoint. YUM!  Hubby had the pork sandwich which he compared to a Cuban like sandwich- also very good.  We had the peach scone with real Creme as our appetizer- deliciously topped with honey. The staff all very friendly, knowledgeable about the food and very attentive. We will most definitely be back again!",4.0,1

Food took 60+ minutes. Jerked goat was substituted for a smoked ribs - without telling me. Another substitution was made to a main dish that one of our group ordered. Hard, un-cushioned hard plank seating made me glad to leave when the check finally came. We're not going back.",2.0,0
Signage out front cant see at night.  Wait staff brought the wrong beer.  Brought the soup with no spoon and the burger with cheese when requested no cheese.  Food was average at best.   I had the fried chicken with a burnt piece of cornbread.  If you are not a drinker drink water.  The soda is full of ice charging 3 dollars and 3 dollars for every refill.   Rip off,1.0,0
Food was tasty and fresh.  We went at a not so busy time right around 5 and there were too much wait staff walking around us it was a bit intrusive.  One waitress had a tiny dress on and I know the ambience is casual and hip but I thought it was a little unprofessional.  Corn bread was amazing!,4.0,1
"We went to the Prairie Whale based on a recommendation from our hotel nearby.  I was a bit disappointed.  I ordered the brick chicken, and after a few bites, I noticed the center was completely raw.  I told the waitress and she whisked it away, no apology.  It took about 20-25 minutes for her to return with the chicken, by which time everyone else was done with their food.  Again, no apology and no adjustment on the bill.  The setting was very nice, and our host was congenial, but the service was very slow and I thought their response to my chicken being served raw was really unacceptable.",2.0,0
"I have never given a 5 star review on Yelp before.  But Prairie Whale deserves it and I had to say something after all the negative reviews on here.  We have eaten here several times and the service has always been good.  I have lived in the area for over 35 years and this is far and away the best restaurant I have been to in the Berkshires.  I spend most of my time in Brooklyn, NY and proprietor, Mark Firth, has done a masterful job transplanting the food-to-table ethos from that neighborhood to this one.  Makes sense as he started three restaurants in BK that put it on the food map with Roman's, Marlow & Sons, and Diner.  The chicken, the pork and even the fish(very hard to get good seafood in the Berkshires) have all been exemplary here.  Not to mention the fresh produce as well.  Mark has taken a very hands on approach to the place and it shows in the food and the warm and inviting atmosphere(Ping Pong and Bluegrass bands outside during the warmer weather!).  So give the place a shot. You'll be glad you did.",5.0,1
"Terrible experience!  The wait on a Saturday night -- in the country, of all places -- was excessively long.  But we get there and decide to stay.   The environment was dark, chaotic, dank, super loud Williamsburg hipster meets country.  It was ALL wrong!  The food was inappropriate trying to be gastro.  Who the hell serves whole porgy -- bony and small for $27?  We had a pasta dish with razor clams that were full of dirt. I was very worried about cracking a tooth.  Not to mention, they were out of every single veggie side we asked for. We couldn't even complain because we saw our waiter only once.  She took our order and disappeared.  We flagged down other servers to assist us.  She came back to ask if we needed another drink after our dinner was completed.  Who does that!?!?  We asked for the brioche bread pudding dessert and they were out of that too.  The food was less than mediocre.  Our experience was so uninspiring and annoying, I just had to write about it.  This place needs some serious tweaking.  I hate hipsters!",1.0,0
"good food, terrible service.  was really looking forward to eating here.  the food was thoughtful, but the service was horrible.  had a waitress called jocelyn.  i think she was hungover.  unfriendly, hurried, unattentive.  very poor representative of the place.  we won't go back and can't recommend it to anyone.  good beer selection, btw.  but if it's beer you want, go to 20 Railroad, which is right around the corner.",1.0,0
"so I went back to Bell & Anchor for a second time. We sat at the bar and ordered several appetizers and an entree to share. The food was very good - no complaints there. But what is up with the wine glasses? My $10 glass of wine came in the most awful catering wine glass! The glass did nothing for the wine and was embarrassing to hold in my hand. When I questioned the bartender about the glass, he showed me the nice wine glass that I remembered from my previous visit. He said that there were so many complaints about the pour size in that glass (which I am guessing is about 5 oz) that they went to this smaller (horrid) glass so that the pour looked better. Wrong Approach! I suggest that you either offer a better pour in that nice glass (raising the price if necessary), invest in a smaller but better quality glass for the same size pour, offer two size pours - I don't know - get creative. I know that I would think twice about ordering a glass of wine in that restaurant if it is going to be served in that awful glass.",4.0,1
"I went last night for the first time. First the critique - from the outside, the restaurant looks warm and inviting but the lights on upstairs with no shades was a huge distraction. Put up shades or turn down the lights. It would be nice to have something on the table to munch on while you consider the menu. The charcuterie plate was not that interesting - all sliced meats. My husband was hoping for some house made sausage or pate (or maybe from a local source like The Meat Market) - maybe a marinated red onion salad rather than the two tiny rings of red onion that came with it. He asked for additional bread ( I think there was one or two pieces on the plate). How about a serving of a delicious mustard to accompany the meats - so much potential to make for a more interesting plate. The chocolate caramel tart needs to be served at room temperature. Ours was cold and impossible to cut into. We did not finish it for that reason. Now for the positive - I loved the ambiance. We were greeted the minute we walked in the door by a very friendly bartender and then the host. Our waiter was excellent - just the right amount of service without being intrusive. We loved the grilled napa cabbage side.  Maybe a more extensive menu would be nice - also more sides to choose from. We would have ordered a bunch of sides to sample. All in all - a very positive experience and we will be back.",4.0,1
LOVED it. What a great place to stop in the middle of a road trip. The Cider Honeybee fall cocktail was absolutely delicious. The sliders were the perfect snack to split. Our server was outstanding. (I'm pretty sure she was the only other than the bartender.) The small parking lot is about a block and a half away but easy to find. Thankful we found this little spot in Great Barrington.,5.0,1
"I had the local salad and the French onion soup, my husband had the mac & cheese with bacon, and both were happy. Each of us had a cocktail as well and they were good. However, we ordered the sliders to go for our son, cooked medium, and were very disappointed when we got back to our hotel room to see them cooked rare.",3.0,0
"Delicious food.  Lots of good options.  Good wines. Quick friendly service.  We got fish & chips and steak. Each was enough for 2 meals, and were both very tasty. We asked to move outside bc it it was so loud inside. Really a 4.5-.5 for noise level. Would definitely return.",4.0,1
"Went in for a burger, very quaint downstairs pub style place. We sat at the bar, and the bartender, Matt was excellent, very friendly and attentive. I ordered the regular burger with sweet potato fries, it was cooked to perfection and the fries were amazing. My sister ordered the CFCG burger, a burger without a bun, with regular fries, also cooked to perfection. My brother in law ordered the buffalo wings and a quesadilla, the sauce on the wings was delicious and they were a good size. Quesadilla was also good, half going home, not to mention the cocktails were I will definitely go back, great spot for a romantic evening too.",5.0,1
"The Well was packed full when we got there so the wait staff took our number and we browsed the Main shop windows until they called us. Their timing estimate was precisely right! All the portions were very generous. We liked the Well salad, taco salad, and the chicken finger platter. They had the TVs on so people could watch sports and I really appreciated that they were on mute with no news or politics.",5.0,1
"First time visit. Arrived around 5:30 PM on a Friday evening, and it was busy; even so, we were granted a table within 25 minutes of a wait. The place is incredibly small with about 8 tables and a bar, so be prepared to wait if you visit during peak hours. The service was good albeit a little slow. Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable, and checked in on us regularly but didn't hover. The kitchen was likely understaffed because it took a considerable amount of time to receive our appetizers and meals after ordering. Fortunately, the food was incredibly tasty. We had the Buffalo cauliflower, fried pickles, Mac n cheese with pulled pork, and black and bleu burger. Additionally we consumed four adult beverages. The bourbon mule was tasty but didn't feel like it had much booze in it. My wife ordered a pomegranate martini; she enjoyed it, but I felt like the flavor was a little unbalanced. We also tried a cider on tap and a beer, both of which were average. In short, we enjoyed the experience. The food made it worth the wait. The drinks were just average though. For a restaurant that is called, ""The Well,"" I'd expect higher quality drinks. Even so, if you're not in a rush and are there for the food more so than the booze, this is worth the trip.",4.0,1
"Have returned to this fun restaurant since my initial review. The food remains above average for what it is. Don't expect fine dining, ( but it's NOT meant to be ) but everything ordered by me, and those I was with, was very tasty and satisfying. The service was improved from my initial visit, the staff remains exceptionally pleasant, and the bottled beer was acceptingly cold ! ( I had complained about warm beer my first visit to The Well. I can't say whether the draught beer is still served insufficiently cold. I still encourage chilled beer glasses. Warm beer - my pet peeve ).  And try the Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich. Excellent ! This is a restaurant to DEFINITELY put on your list when in Great Barrington.",3.0,0
"Have been curious about this quaint restaurant for several years, so my family and I decided to try it out last night before Berkshire Busk. The restaurant was quite busy so the 30-40 minute wait was expected. The staff are all quite pleasant and friendly, however efficient  is definitely NOT the term I would us to describe them. I'm not sure whether the issue was the waitress or the kitchen, nevertheless the wait time between time the order was placed and time the food was served was excessive ... very excessive. Also, after realizing that we were waiting a long time for our food, the waitress told us the nacho appetizer was coming right out. I guess ""coming right out"" means when the entrees are ready to be served.  I must say though that the shrimp po' boy sandwich was exceptionally tasty. The Buffalo wings were tasty as well, however not nearly crispy enough. Along with the wait time, my primary criticism of this restaurant is the beer. The variety is fine, but when  serving beer a restaurant should be sure that the beer is cold, not warm ! Chilled beer glasses would have been helpful.",2.0,0

"Back in 2019, my husband and I tried getting a table at this establishment. The place is so small and cramped and there doesn't seem to even be a host stand. We got frustrated and left but promised ourselves we'd someday return.Cut to- 2021. ""Surely, this place won't be as crowded as it was pre-covid"", thought we. And The Well gods laughed. I think it was even more crowded and even less organized! The busboy wrote our names on a post-it, with a pen that had clearly run out of ink. We waited (more like wandered around town) for about 45 minutes and returned to The Well to wait some more. Our table was finally(!) ready. We were kind of disappointed by the experience up until this point...but then everything changed. The waitress- I want to say her name was Hannah- she def looked like a Hannah, anyway- was incredible. Super attentive and friendly and not at all annoying. We ordered our drinks and an appetizer. She never once rushed us to put our entree orders in. We got the nachos to start and then both got veggie burgers. De.LISH! Omg this food still has me dreaming. So good! Probably the best in Great Barrington. I couldn't get enough of the fries. The burgers were full of veggies and not fillers like most non-meat options. The food was a homerun. My husband always tells me not to judge small town restaurants with NYC standards, so I'm giving The Well 5 stars because I honestly think the food and service deserve it. However, I feel like there's so much potential to improve from a systems point of view. I know it's called ""the well"" but I kinda feel like the bar is too big. I wish they would restructure and put more tables. Or somehow expand? I just really love this place and want it to get the accolades it deserves- and, of course, I don't want to wait an hour for a table.",5.0,1

I wish I lived closer so that we could come more often and enjoy, but in the end my wallet is healthier without.Bottom Line:Throughout our entire dinner the service was prompt and friendly, food was delicious, and the drinks were perfectly made. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.",5.0,1
"Visiting the area for the first time and decided to try this restaurant.  I ordered the special, which was chicken and shrimp paella.  The paella had no seasoning at all, wasn't too bad with lots & lots of salt & pepper.  Carrots were very crunchy, definitely could have used another 2 minutes cooking time at least.  Lots & lots of peas.  The chef here should refrain from attempting what he doesn't know.  I would say: stick to the pub food if you go to this establishment.  Atmosphere - pleasant.  Service- fair.",2.0,0
"I'm actually torn with this because I'd really like to give this place 2.5 stars. In any case, here's the scoop on The Well. We arrived mid-Saturday afternoon. There's no place to really stand in the restaurant as you basically walk right into the small dining room. So we waited for someone to acknowledge that we were even there. No one did. So after about 10 min of awkwardly just standing there we asked one of the servers who was wiping down an open booth if she was wiping that down for us to which she nodded her head ""yes"". (Must've been too difficult for her to muster up any words.)A few moments later, we sat and perused the menu. Again, we waited. Now for about 10 more minutes. Two servers were working the floor. No one popped by to say they were running late or would be with us in a few. Nothing. We were just ignored. FINALLY, after 15 minutes our server greeted us asking what we wanted for drinks so we thought it'd be best to just give her the entire order. So we did. Veggie nachos, onion rings to start. Then two greek salads w/chicken, a bowl of french onion soup and one chicken sandwich. The nachos and wings were both delicious. Plenty of cheese and veggies surrounding each chip and the chips were crispy. The rings were also very good. Crispy and just the right batter/onion ratio. There was a decent amount of time between our apps and lunches which was good. Everything seemed ok except half way through my greek salad I found a rather large hair that was wrapped around most of the bottom lettuces on the plate. (barf.) I tracked down the server (because we really never saw her as she never came by to ask if we needed anything) - told her about the hair. She asked if I wanted another salad to which I said ""no.""So all in all the food was fine but between the hairy salad and the lack of acknowledgment to guests as they just waited to be noticed was pretty unforgivable as it doesn't take much to say hi and give an update on what's happening. Therefore 2 stars it is, The Well.",2.0,0
"We love The Well and go there often - we consider it the ""Cheers"" of Great Barrington!  They have a great menu, friendly staff, good service and overall it's always a good time.  The Popcorn Shrimp is always a good starter and I love their Shrimp Po Boy.  I don't love their fries, I have to say ... but everything else is really good!  We usually get the onion rings.  It's nice to know that The Well uses locally-procured products and they are careful about the sourcing quality of their food.",5.0,1
"If you like $17 martinis this is the place for you!Greatest Dirty Martini in the WorldThe Martinis at The Well are the greatest Dirty Martinis in the world. In my seventy eight years travelling this planet I have never encountered anything as delicious. The vermouth was superb, the gin amazing and the olives just marvelous.  The dirty olive juice must have been flown in from Santorini, Greece where the locals stomped the olives with their bare feet after washing them before of course. The mixologist at The Well had to have trained at The Great Bartending School in Newark, New Jersey. There is no other reason the Martinis could be so wonderful at The Well than that their bartender won the famous 2018 IBA World Cocktail Championship in Tallinn, Estonia. And I should know because I was the runner up in 2014 at the forty fourth IBA World Championship in Capetown, South Africa. The $17 price tag for this stupendous drink is worth every cent.

"Beer was cold and burger was delicious. Nice atmosphere, but service was horrible. Went in with a party of 7 , after a long day at work. The waitress informed us that she was new and took our order. Soon after we were served but she forgot to put in my order and I sat there drinking heavily watching my co workers enjoy their food. My burger came out as my partners were finishing up their meals, it was good but by then I must have had 8-10 beers. I was drunk and only ate half the burger. I do remember enjoying it but I was pissed off. The waitress new I was unhappy and took all my beers of the bill. We went back a week later because it happens to be one of the best spots in town , I had the pulled pork quesadilla , it was amazing. The service was also better, she remembered us and let me order my food first, she promised she wouldn't forget this time. She had a sense of humor and sharpened up her skills. I will go back, to try the burger again. Excellent food, high recommend if you in the Berkshires.",4.0,1

The atmosphere and food at The Well was great!! They have Gluten-Free options as well as other allergen free options. The food was nice and fresh. The portions were a good size.  The next time I am in the Berkshires I will definitely go back for another great meal.,4.0,1
I was travelling for work and found this place on Yelp.   I found a spot at the bar.  The service was great.  I wasn't looking for a big meal  and asked for an app and something else and they were very accommodating.  I started chatting with the couple next to me and had a great time.  It seemed like a great mix of regulars and visitors (school vacation week).  I had a very full hummus plate and garlic (very!!) wings.  The rest of the food I saw going by looking pretty good.,4.0,1
"Stopped in with my boyfriend for drinks before we wandered around looking for a dinner spot.  I ordered the Arnold Palmer, while my boyfriend kept it simple with a Sam summer.  While we were there, the table next to us ordered wings, so we decided to order some - they were really, really good.All the food coming out looked really good, so we caved and decided to get dinner here.  I ordered a salad, my boyfriend ordered the steak.  The salad was good, not the best I've ever had, but it was probably the wrong thing to order here.  The steak was DELICIOUS, cooked perfectly.  I would absolutely recommend!",4.0,1

"Delicious, fresh food!  Staff is very friendly too.  I would have given 5 stars, but its just not comfortable when you have to stand around awkwardly waiting for a seat at a table or the bar.  Its so small.  This makes for the nice atmosphere, but everyone waiting is just in the way.  I honestly feel for the staff that have to maneuver around this joint.  Summer is nice when you can wait outside, but we all know the Berkshires is pretty darn cold most months, lol! Not sure if expansion is an option, but everyone loves this place.  You would make a killing!  Thanks for the awesome food and drinks The Well! :)",4.0,1

"My favorite place in Gt. Barrington for a simple warm meal and a brew!Really warm atmosphere and great friendly service. Quite often by the owners themselves (Biff & Juliet) You'll always feel like your amongst friends and if you're really lucky you'll end up there on a night that includes Biff's awesome fried chicken.  Sound kinda simple? Believe me, I have never in my life had fried chicken this good! Sorry Mom and Grandma... that includes yours too! If you're really daring you'll try their AdventureUs Burger. Once I gathered up the guts to try it, it became my favorite burger in the ""Burgshires""!Another eatery that keeps their prices affordable enough for the local working community! Well, Well Well!",4.0,1
"The Well is a sweet spot for drinks and typical American fare in Great Barrington, MA. You could say this is the town's local dive bar or as close to one as it's going to get out here in the Berkshires. All in all, the Well is a good choice if you're just lookin' for a casual somewhere to hang out with friends and snack on some meaty and greasy bar food. Wasn't super impress by the food/vibe here but wasn't necessarily disappointed by it either.You should try their wings which is what The Well seems to be known for. Personally, I wasn't that wow-ed by them. Hey -- they've got this award for ""Best Wings in the Berkshires"" hanging on the wall, so there were some high expectations! I'd say I'm a little bit of a wing-connoisseur... I eat a lot of them and these were definitely not the best I've had in the Berkshires (refer to review on Old Forge). I'd also recommend getting the Adventurer's burger!  How can you go wrong with peanut butter and bacon? Obviously the most perfect combination (now) known to man/(me). Yum, yum!The lava lamps were a very cool touch. Couldn't help but get a little hypnotized and lost while staring at the one on my table. Let's just say my attention span is equivalent to a fly's, i.e. OoOoh, bright lights! Must touch...",3.0,0
"It's been three years since I've been to The Well. Either I picked a ""good night"" on my one previous visit, or tonight was a bad one. According to my friends that I was with, I was experiencing a typical Saturday night.YIKES.As one friend said, ""We need to end our night getting a drink up the street at Allium, because we can NOT end our night on this note."" And this is from a kid that's used to putting up with the douchier aspects of the Boston bar scene.Crowded and rowdy, but not all was lost. It was fun watching drunken blonde girls lip-synch and grind to Shaggy's ""It Wasn't Me"" with their friends while giggling, they played ""The Humpty Dance"", ""Hypnotize"" was requisitely spun, and the lava lamps are still very much there. NOT my scene, but it made for a hilarious and fun-filled 20 minutes. Conversely, I was VERY glad to make my exit.",3.0,0
I've only been there once and was completely compelled by the use of Christmas lights and lava lamps. The Irish waiter compelled my friend. It was a friendly place not filled with the usual douchery / trashy people that can flood the local restaurants and bars. Did I mention the lava lamps? Lava lamps. I love lamp.Chill and relaxed with good people. That's all I want in a bar.,4.0,1

I have even noticed him not allowing patrons in while he has a full bar and allows his ""friends"" who are very intoxicated as well to come in while not allowing other patrons past. Very unprofessional, he does not seem to fit a bar managers ""standards"" and ""ethics.",1.0,0

I don't drink so this review is only about the food. The BF and I came in here on a weekday afternoon. I ordered the shrimp po boy and the BF ordered a chicken salad of some sort. The food was particularly good for bar food standards.  It's a small space so I can see how it can get crowded. This is a good place to come in for a quick yummy bite.,4.0,1
"Loved the drinks! The atmosphere was cool, the bartender Gavin made  such super strong drinks that my friends and I got rowdy, and silly. then Gavin's friends ( possibly one being his girlfriend), seemed hostile and snobby when I tried having a conversation with them,granted I had a few drinks in me, but I remember being nice, but the moment I tried engaging in small talk,I felt like I was immediately back in high school being shunned by the cool kids. Gavin was very nice but his friends ( especially the girlfriend ) were not, it never hurts to be nice, its a freakn  bar! you never know when someone's going to yelp your ass.

But we both agreed that the burgers, chicken and everything else that came out of the kitchen looked excellent and the people next to us said it was. We will go back.",4.0,1

We have always had good food and drink at The Well's very comfortable bar.  But we have been disapointed twice now by showing up at the door for lunch (on Saturdays) and finding that they don't open until 4:00......on a weekend....come on.We probably won't depend on them being open for long.,3.0,0
"This place was great! After ditching GB Eats for terrible service, this place reminded us of the charm of Great Barrington.

"After trying both 21 Railroad St (packed) and Barrington Brewery (also packed) we ended up back at The Well for dinner and drinks with friends. Small place, and we had to wait awhile (which consisted of milling about in the middle of the place since there was really no waiting area.) Nice area of town, though parking was tricky (we managed to get a spot up at the old train station.) Decor was funky (lava lamps!) and eclectic. A mix of patrons including families. The food was reasonably priced, simple but good fare, no complaints about that. I had a BBQ chicken quesadilla that I didn't regret. The drinks were fantastic! I had a Godiva Chocolatini that made my knees quiver. There was something else on the menu that involved hot spiced cider and rum that I really wanted to give a shot as well, but after the chocolate concoction I figured I better stop there. Maybe next time.",3.0,0

I have only been here a few times when I have been in the Berkshires and really liked the atmosphere.  It felt cozy like your neighborhood pub but more upscale.  The bartender/ owner was also great.

"A basic bar in downtown GB. It's a major locals hangout; there really aren't that many bars in town so everybody tends to wind up here, it seems. The beer range is nothing special for the grizzled beer geek but they do have lots of the classic craft beer brands, such as Dogfish Head, Blue Point, Sierra Nevada, etc. Good value on the beers - most are $5-6 per pint. A few bottles supplement the keg lineup. Friendly enough service. There are a couple TVs showing whatever big sporting event is most pressing. They have a full menu here but I've never gotten food. If you're in GB and want to hang out in a bar, this is your spot.",3.0,0

"Stopped in for a drink the first night we were in town, and we knew we had to drop by again for dinner.  We were not disappointed. We started with the garlic buffalo wings.  Not too much garlic and the wings were cooked just right. For dinner we had the fried chicken and the Well Salad.  A very generous 1/2 chicken cooked perfectly, not dry. The sides were mashed potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus were a little crisp, not soggy, and the mashed potatoes were homemade with a hint of bacon.  The salad had wonderful nice fresh greens, cranberries, walnuts, and goat cheese with a nice raspberry vinaigrette.  The crowed tends to be local and very friendly.  If you find yourself in the area, stop by, you will not be disappointed.",4.0,1
"My husband and I went to  the Well for the first time last weekend.  We were there for lunch on Saturday.  The restaurant is very nice-quaint with exposed stone and brick.  Everything was great at first; the food was good and the bartender was very friendly.  Then a young man took a seat at the bar. He was one of those ""loud talkers"" who talked non stop and laughed so loud it was embarrassing.  Also strange was that he sat with a young boy (at the bar!). He was obviously a regular and knew the bar server.  We finally gave up and left.  He was just too obnoxious.  Later that evening we decided to go back and try again for a night cap.  Five minutes after we arrived guess who showed up ? He's back!  The restaurant is quite small so moving was not an option.  I'm all for regulars but someone there needs to have a talk with this young man.  We were not the only ones who were put off by him. (by the way the young boy also was there and sat next to him at the bar again.)",3.0,0
Started out with the loaded garden nachos. It kept our group of 3 totally satisfied. They were delicious with our speciality cocktails. For dinner the grilled Faroe Island Salmon was outrageous. There are new owners here who have redone everything about this restaurant. The decor is warm and inviting and the food is delicious and reasonably priced. Will absolutely be back whenever we are in Great Barrington. Can't recommend enough.,5.0,1

"First time there under the new management.  It was 10000x better than the last.  Last time the food was messy and kinda crappy, but now thats not the case.  Honestly I don't know if it's because of how bad the food and drinks were last time, but I can't stress this enough.--- If you went to the Well before it was under new management don't be afraid to go back because it isn't as shitty as before.  Actually I reckon that you give it another try you won't regret it.  I got a burger and sweet potato fries (gotta cut back on them calories) and it was A1 (great).  I got the burger done medium and it was done nearly perfect (nothings perfect besides my face).  The fries were crispy at the end and more soft towards the middle.  The environment there was friendly.  Incase your socially awkward or eating alone yes, they do have wifi.  If you're around the area and want to get a bite to eat sit down or a quick bite.  I recommend the new improved Well.",5.0,1
"Tried the well after years of loyalty to 20 Railroad eventually collapsed. The food is very good given the price/type of place and it is clean and a sort of nifty atmosphere, a basement vibe but plenty bright, with exposed brick and bleached white plaster and rough hewn beans and all.  I am reading it is a ""dive bar"" but if this is what passes for a Dive in GB, then Katy bar the door, GB is upscale!  Seriously, the wings are decent (award winning?  Nah, but good enough).  The burgers are great - juicy, flavorful.  The waitress (we have had the same one each of the 3 times we've gone) is very friendly, efficient.   The place is pretty small, and I suspect if crowded it could be a wait for the food, but I would take this over 22 RR and the other burger place in town (Gypsy Joint, what a joke).",3.0,0

"The Well is a friendly and laid back restaurant and bar. Their ""garlic buffalo"" wings and grass fed beef burgers do not disappoint. Portions are generous, and there is a nice variety.

Lots to choose from in an inviting atmosphere. Be sure to check out The Well when in GB.",5.0,1
"Stopped in for our first visit to The Well before a show at the Mahawie Theater . We ordered the garlic & buffalo wings  and a cheese pizza , it was just the right amount of food for two. The wings were tasty , although size wise a bit on  the wimpy side. Pizza had a nice thin crispy crust and was quite delic !  The service was  good. We would definitely return  to this little basement pub !",4.0,1

"Wow. First, let me say I am not a drinker so when 3 friends decided to eat here I thought It would be all fries and wings. Wrong. I was surprised by the vastness of the menu. There was certainly pub fare, but the salads and entrees were impressive. So I had The Go Greens with chicken pesto salad with raspberry vinaigrette which was organic and delicious, and beautifully presented. My friends had the steamed clams, chili and a half-rack of smoked bbq ribs. The clam broth was perfectly seasoned in garlic and spices. We soaked it all up with the toast points. Ribs tasted like they were just off the grill, tender and flavorful. Our waiter was polite, prompt and patiently gave us separate checks, even though we asked at the end. When we went (on a wednesday) it wasn't so loud and I actually liked the music playing. The prices are easy on the wallet too. I liked the relaxing vibe. I actually left in a better mood than when we came in. I will be back.",5.0,1

Since our first time going s few years ago,  we always come back to Aegean Breeze",4.0,1
"For some reason, I have never been here. But I do want to go back and give it a try. Seems like a nice family-run Greek restaurant with quality food. Perfect for a family dinner, but probably not for a first date or special occasion.My wife and I each ordered on of the Greek specialties. I had the Braised Lamb Ragout Stew, which was flavorful enough that I finished the portion. I think it could have had more Greek spices in it. Good, but I won't order it again. My wife had the Filet of Sole ""Plaki"" Style. She said that the sauce overpowered the sole and she could barely taste the fish.I think the fault was ours. We should have ordered the more simple items on the menu, such as the kebobs or pita wraps. My guess is that they are the items most commonly ordered. And, they looked good.The person at the table next to me said the best thing to do is to have a dinner of appetizers. He particularly suggested the Char Grilled Octopus and the Grilled Loukaniko (lamb and pork sausage). They both looked great. I think that ordering those with a Greek salad will be what I do next time.",5.0,1
"Very cozy Greek restaurant with an authentic feel to it + a comprehensive menu I came here with my family and we split a ton of dishes including the hummus, octopus, and baked cheese.

The moussaka came out cold on the bottom layer. It had to be sent back to be warmed. The fresh cut Greek fries are more like fried potato chips. We weren't expecting that. Overall the food was good. Two of us would have given the overall experience a 7.5 while one of the three of us said 4.",5.0,1
We had a large group of family and friends who had a hankering for Mediterranean food. Aegean Breeze supplied the best. We started with the assorted appetizers and went on to the sundry main course items. I don't often eat dessert but the black and white layer cake demanded my attention. The Greek coffee hit the spot. I want to pay special attention to the staff. They were patient and provided great suggestions for those who weren't familiar with the cuisine.,3.0,0
"The restaurant decor was very rustic, felt like you were in a tavern. They still seemed to have some partitions up from COVID. These gave us more privacy but made it feel a little cramped. Due to dietary restrictions I was very limited by what I could order here. I ordered the swordfish steak. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was! It was cooked perfectly! It wasn't too tough; it had very subtle seasoning. Unfortunately I tried the Mediterranean rice first and it was barely warm so that wasn't a good first impression. My friend ordered the baby lamb chops medium rare. He wasn't happy that each lamb chop was cooked to a different level - one rare, one well done, one medium. He enjoyed the lemon potatoes more than the lamb. Total bill for our 2 entrees and a soda $68.I'd be willing to give this place another try though. I would've loved to have try some appetizers and more Greek specialties.",5.0,1

The Calamari was obviously made fresh in house...not from a frozen bag as you get in many places....especially those far from the sea.,4.5,1
"Great little spot! I was unsure of what to expect due to mixed reviews but the menu looked good so I gave it a try. Super glad I did! I had the avgolemono soup, spicy feta and saganaki. They were all fabulous! I had a chicken souvlaki with fries (which were actually homemade chips) and my lunch date had lamb gyro over lemon potatoes. The gyro was good but not amazing-still worth trying! Bonus points to Aegean for accommodating our two dogs on their large patio. Thanks for the great lunch Aegean Breeze!",4.0,1
"Came here on the recommendation of friends. Really good. I had the salad with roasted beets with gyro. Started with the chicken lemon rice soup. It was thicker I expected (anticipated a more broth like base) though it was very good, especially after a squeeze of fresh lemon. My partner had the arugula salad and said it was good. Complimentary Greek pita and olives were very good. Only minor issue was that it was really warm inside. Next time, we'll dine outside.",5.0,1

Lovely covered patio with overhead fans.My grilled lamb chops and galaktoboreko custard filo dessert were excellent. Hubby liked his gigante beans and other veggies. I enjoyed tastes of the lamb stew and sole that our friends ordered. The service was pleasant.,4.0,1
"Stopped by for lunch while driving through town! Was seated right away by friendly staff. Ordered grilled octopus and falafels for appetizer. Both were good, really liked the falafel here! I had the lamb with veggies and found the lamb to be a little tough. My friend ordered the steak and said his was slightly overcooked as well since he asked for it medium. I also tried the salmon and scallops and thought they were delicious! The potatoes and rice were more acidic/ zesty than i am used to and not what I typically expected but not bad!",2.0,0
"Have eaten here a few times in the past and at times it was pretty good.  Yesterday it was not.  Three diners having lamb chops, two chicken kabob dinners and  a Greek salad for four.  The salad was fine accept we weren't given serving utensils or salad plates.  The main dishes came out so fast that it seemed like everything was precooked and reheated and it tasted like that too.  Very bland tasting chicken and not grilled.  They served one pita bread sliced thinly into several pieces for 3 people.  We asked for more and were charged extra for the same.  No tzatziki sauce served with kabobs and was also charged extra for that too.  Service was not very attentive even tho there were plenty of servers.  After food was dropped off no one showed up to take menus or used dishes away.  Very disappointed.  Won't be back.",5.0,1
"One of my favorite cuisines is Greek, and we don't have a really good Greek restaurant in our area.  As it happened, my husband and I were driving through Great Barrington and planned to stop for lunch.  I chose Aegean Breeze and am so glad that I did!It's a challenge to find a decent restaurant (that's not fast food) open on a Monday.  It was well after the midday rush, so we were not surprised to find that we were the only patrons at 2:30 p.m..  Two other couples were leaving as we arrived on a snowy afternoon.We were met warmly by the owner, Irini.  Our server, Peter, was attentive and very pleasant.  The setting is what I am going to call 'Berkshire Greek' with comfortable, Colonial-style seating (separated by wooden panels, nicely done) with cushioned chairs, a fireplace roaring, and hints of Greek art on the walls.  Plus a truly Greek blue barn door at the back of the dining room.The menu contains the typical Mediterranean offerings that one would expect.  We decided to explore their Cold Greek Appetizer Sampler comprising Tzatziki, Taramosalata, and Stuffed Grape Leaves.  The accompanying pita bread, cut into manageable pieces, was delightfully warm and tasty (we meant to ask them where they got it).  I was told that everything is made in-house.  Not so sure about the grape leaves (they seemed 'typical' although they were very good) but the Tzatziki and Taramosalata?  Definitely homemade and excellent.My husband ordered their Traditional Gyro which was very good.  The accompanying Greek salad was fresh.  I chose their Char-Grilled Octopus (an appetizer) for my entrée.  Let me tell you, I am a huge fan of Greek food and this was among the best I have ever eaten.  Perfectly grilled, and not rubbery.  The caper and lemon sauce, with a hint of sweetness, was divine.We did not have room for dessert and were concerned about our drive back to New York State in the snowstorm, so we ordered Baklava (which was a really treat later that day when we got home) to go.  I also added a serving of their excellent Taramosalata to our take-out order.If you enjoy Greek and Mediterranean cuisine, then by all means this is the place to dine.  I can't wait to return.",4.5,1

"I really wanted to like this place! They had food that my daughter could eat, and I'm a huge fan of Greek food. It was expensive for what it was, the drink menu was lacking and everything looked like it needed a major upgrade. When the appetizers came out, for 20 dollars we got three small scoops of cold mezze. Everything was lacking salt. My Prosecco tasted like it had been there far too long. The menu looked interesting and there was so much I was willing to try, but we left after the appetizers. The restaurant wasn't busy, and it took 10 mins for someone to come and collect the cheque. They seated us outside and everyone else was inside - and started cleaning up outside and while people were still coming in to eat. It felt very strange. They have the potential to be amazing and I really hope they make some changes!",3.0,0
"Cute place. Good service. Food average, sorry to say , but nice experience. Ordered the island tomato salad, ( Greek salad with no lettuce). I asked for no peppers , which was fine but didn't realize till later that there were no olives on the salad, which I realized when I looked at the picture later.  Used to Greek/ Mediterranean restaurants putting pita and some dip or olives on the table to start, complimentary . Also no staff wore masks, which I would have appreciated . Staff was friendly however.  They said there was no outdoor dining at this time.  There is a side glass enclosed porch like area , which they may use at other times, or when it is not as cold.",5.0,1
"For some reason, despite living in the area for a quarter of a century we have never dropped in. On my 70th birthday, my wife asked me what I wanted to eat that day. As a New York City-er, It had been years since I'd had a true gyro that lived up...until today. This is the real thing. But what IU hadn't expected when I'd agreed to ""fries"" was that the potatoes would be a crisp, totally un-oily  cross between fries and chips. We're going back, like, tomnorrow.",5.0,1
"De.Lish.!We arrived in GB pretty late and needed to find a solid place that offers takeout. Aegean fit the bill. With so many vegetarian options to choose from, I ordered the falafel pita with potatoes on the side. Most places offer their falafel in the form of balls, which I'm assuming is traditional (I'm actually pretty new to falafel but a huge fan). Aegean's falafel is actually cut from what I believe to be patties. This made for a much more manageable pita that was a delight to eat. The only thing that would have made it better would have been feta cheese and tzatziki. I'll def ask for both next time, and there will absolutely be a next time!",5.0,1

"We had called days before to make a reservation, but we're told they don't take reservations for only two people.  Our waiter was courteous, but the woman who came to the front podium after we walked through the front door, and after we stood there waiting for more than five minutes, was rude to ignore us. She then explained they were busy and it might be another 20 minutes before they could spare a waiter to take our order. I asked if we should come back or continue to stand there? She finally offered to seat us in the back, where there were several open tables, and we were fine with that. My wife's salmon was partially cooked on the outside, but undercooked on the inside. The Greek salad underneath it was otherwise par for the course. My zucchini was too ""al dente,"" but the carrots were fine and the Plaki (fish under tomato and onion sauce) was very good. I've had Plaki as cod or fillet of sole and enjoy it either way. This place felt more like an urban Greek diner than a Berkshires restaurant, except that we like both the food and ambience of our local Greek diners in Nassau County NY much better.",5.0,1
"I'm sure the locals know and love this place already, but we had a wonderful meal with delightful service about an hour ago: a Greek salad, filet of sole with tomato-onion sauce on top, garlicky rice, and a side of lemon potatoes.  It all tasted delicious -- home-cooking but better than Grandma's -- and the waitperson (whose name, alas, I didn't get) was a marvel of genuine friendliness.  Memorable in its candid down-home approach to food and to the diner.  We come from New York, but we'll stop here on our next trip.",4.5,1

"We have frequented Aegean breeze several times. In the past the food has been very well prepared with a uniquely Greek taste and a good value price wise.  On this last visit, we were a bit disappointed with the flavor of the food. Particularly the grilled items we ordered, chicken, octopus, shrimp scampi. We also felt the menu prices have increased quite a bit. Our dinner was about $100 per person, which seems pricey for this restaurant. The service was terrific, and as always, the ambience was wonderful. We may try it again and hopefully we were there just for an off night.",5.0,1
"I had the Chicken Santorini Casserole. It was phenomenal. All of the appetizers were also great. The stuffed Grape Leaves were the best version of that dish I've had. Pitas were fresh.

On the busy Route 7 but happy to have opportunity to have elfresco Mother's Day lunch.  Since it's Aegean we had giro and a salad with giro meat.  Very nice.  Dinner menu looks good too but we wanted a lighter fare for lunch.  Maybe a salad with some of those crab cakes offered for dinner would be an welcome special...,3.0,0
"We thought lunch here would be great today, and on the whole it was. We both had pitas, hers with beef and mine with falafel. Mine came with a small Greek salad containing one olive and no visible feta cheese. Hers came with what was called Greek fries which turned out to be plain fries and only 10 small fries, hardly enough to count. The price if these pitas was about five dollars overpriced for what we received.The service was mediocre at best. Two young women playing tag team, one took our order and disappeared. The other plopped our dishes down in front of us and walked away. That one cane back and asked how we were and walked away before we could answer. We had to ask for a tea refill and then we only saw them again to give us our bill. It was a disappointing experience. We will not return.",5.0,1

When we asked, got got a tiny amount (and found a $1 charge on the bill). Same for bread. We got so little, and when we asked for more got an additional charge.",2.0,0
Skip it!! Not worth the moneey. Service was extremely slow. We sat with empty drinks the entire meal. The lamb was overcooked and tasteless. The gyros were bland. Such a disappointment.

"My experience is limited to take out but the interior is dated - in a very good way - comfortable and reminds you of family run restaurants of old. The food is authentic and good!  Try the Kalamata olive spread and octopus for appetizer.  Salads as entrees are solid.  The grilled shrimp are tender and cooked perfectly.  All above warrants 5 Stars.  What stands out is their customer service.  I had ordered take out and a dish was left off the order.  I called back when I got home and asked about it and they were genuinely interested in correcting the situation.  Since we had more than enough we decided to take a credit for another day. We went back the next day to pick up the salad that was left off, they didn't forget and had it ready for us. Thing is, it turns out we weren't charged for the item as we thought it just wasn't included on the original order.  The manager gave it to us for free anyway because of the mix up.  Very considerate of giving their customers a good overall experience.  I recommend it!",1.0,0
"An absolute disappointment. I ordered the scallops thinking that for $30 there would be an ample portion and I could get two meals out of it. Wrong. There were only 4 medium sized scallops. There is no way 4 scallops cost $30. The sides were mediocre at best. Zucchini was over cooked while the carrots were undercooked with a side of boiled potatoes. The whole meal was swimming in liquid and actually spilled on the server when she brought us our plates. I was shocked when the bill came and my gin and tonic cost $13. It was weak and only tasted of tonic water. My husband ordered the gyro and was equally disappointed stating that it lacked flavor. The bathroom was absolutely disgusting and smelled strongly of feces. Do not go here, it is a tourist trap. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day with this place.",5.0,1

Definitely worth trying if you're in the area! The service is always super quick. We've gone during slow hours so there's not many people there but it's awesome. There's also a little fire you can sit right by and warm up.,5.0,1
"Y'all this is a must do !!!! I haven't posted a review in awhile. Maybe a Covid slump or maybe nothing compelled me to until this place. I love Mediterranean food. It's healthier and so full of flavor yet so simple. I will say when I walked into the restaurant I did think it was a little out dated and the front entry way smelled of moth balls. But that was neither here nor there after the yummy meal. We sat outside because ya know covid, plus it was nice out. They have a lovely patio much if it covered which is probably great for rainy orColder days. I imagine they will do their outdoor season longer because of it. There menu was so challenging to pick from , so many good things !!!! We ended up getting the sesame honey fig baked feta (don't remember what the actually name of it was) and that was so flavorful. Salty and sweet and perfect ! We also go the lightly fried vegetables that had a very Greek name which I am not going to attempt. And they were so full of flavor and delicious !!!! For our meals I had the seafood Santorini. I was stressed I picked the wrong thing because I kept seeing impressive salads and sandwiches going by that looked so tantalizing. But boy did I pick good. I can't even begin to imagine what they put in the tomato sauce to make it so rich!!!!!! It had a prettt strong sweetness which was effectively countered by what I suspect was lemon ? Or maybe it was just all the garlic. But this sauce. I could have drank it. Needless to say my small casserole dish was clean when I was done. The person I was with got the sardines off the chargrilled which was also excellent ! I cannot stress enough how much I liked this place !",5.0,1

The fish came out lukewarm and the rice was cold. I sent the rice back and when it eventually came the the rice tasted rancid ( all at the table agreed). We asked for bread and then needed to ask for oil or butter separately. We all did not want to spoil our time out, so did not send anything back. When I mentioned that the rice should not be served to others at the end of the meal, the waitress was not surprised and said she would let the kitchen know. The others at my table had sandwiches, which they said were fine, but no one finished their meal and all said they would not come back.",1.0,0
I really don't know how this place has stayed in business. When you enter there is an unclean smell that permeates. We ate outside - though very few people i-- the service was extremely slow. If you don't know what real good Greek food tastes like you might find this place palatable. Salad was soggy - the salmon was dry and the Greek fries were greasy potato chips. Overpriced also.

"We were greeted cheerfully and quickly offered seating. Unfortunately, we were offered either a small seat right by a busy door to the outside seating area, or loud high traffic seating in the middle of the outdoor seating area. Both of these options are objectively bad seats. Once seated, we noticed that there were other options available. We asked a waitress and told we could move ourselves. Service remained cold, though not rude, throughout our meal.  Food was okay, though I frequently go to a Greek diner where I live and get the same portions for slightly less than half the price. I had the spanikopita and overall ok. Wine by the glass was not good- I had a red that was clearly spoiled / off. Dessert menu no prices, and printed on a worn out piece of paper. Hmm. I think this place needs to improve. Overall given the number of 5 star reviews I see here on Yelp, that probably won't be happening and the restaurant won't be listening.",5.0,1

"We stopped here because we have eaten here in the past. Usually my dining mate and I order the felafel appetizer with hummus plus a variety of the mezze of 3 other appetizers such as  feta , cavier and eggplant spread along with pita bread .The felafel are very good but not as crunchy on the outside as I prefer, and I thought these were perhaps baked and not fried, the hummus  smooth and tasty. The Trio of dips we chose are also very good along with fresh soft pita bread.We also ordered a felafel wrap with a side of Greek salad, a steak  kabob with rice and a kids steak and fries dinner. The steak was tasty and moderately tender. We ate outside under a tent which was nice. The service was friendly.The menu features many choices for grilled fish and meat, a variety of salads, wraps, main entrees and appetizers and lunch specials.We also ordered a Greek beer. Prices moderate, portion size good.However, my guests probably would not return.We were charged $6 for a glass of iced coffee! $12 for our 2 glasses which we thought outrageous  because a hot cup of coffee was $2.50 ,the beer $5 a bottle and a kids steak dinner $8.!When I asked about the price  of the iced coffee, our server said she had nothing to do about the prices.  I would of expected a different reply  from her  or her to recheck our bill, but we did not want to create a negative situation on this nice day.   I believed we were mistakenly overcharged for 4 instead of 2 ice coffees.",5.0,1
The setting was middle of the road. Not fancy but not dingy. We sat outside on the patio under the tent because it was nice out. It's right across the street from the dispensary (if that interests you). The food was really good which is why I'm giving this 5 stars. We got the falafel pitas with tzatziki on the side. The falafel were so fresh and delicious. The hummus was a little in the overpowering garlic side. But manageable. The pita bread was fresh and soft. The fries are my kind of fries which are on the line with chips. I liked it and would go back if I wanted falafel.,5.0,1

"This restaurant serves overpriced yet underwhelming Mediterranean cuisine. The avgolemeno soup was the best tasting item that we ordered and even that wasn't great. The lamb was gamey, tough and had no salt on it so it was tasteless. The chicken Santorini was burnt and therefore inedible.

The tzatziki sauce was really good. I also enjoyed the fries, they were seasoned well. My husband had the lamb chops and lemon potatoes and he enjoyed that as well. Service was good. Great dinner!",3.0,0

"Food is delicious, authentic Greek food. Food is 5 stars. The service on Easter evening is the reason for the overall 3 star experience. Our server, the one who sounds like she's reading from a script that she's read from too many times, and asks, ""May I clear?"" was not friendly, not informed on the menu, and not helpful. I had specifically picked this restaurant because my girlfriend is Greek and we were missing out on her family's large and beautiful Easter celebration. We left disappointed by such an awful experience. We will most likely not go back to this restaurant on our future trips to the Berkshires.",2.0,0
"We've been coming to the Berkshires for more than 40 years. Tonight was the first time we tried Aegean Breeze. We were not disappointed. The setting was perfect- dinner on the patio on a beautiful, mild evening. The waitress brought us water, warm pita bites and olives as soon as we were seated. My husband ordered a burger and fries and I ordered the lamb gyro. When the meal was delivered, the waitress brought a bottle of ketchup, which my husband picked up, poured on his burger and then tried to place it back on the table. It promptly slipped out of his hand and rolled off the table, crashing (and breaking!) on the stone patio! So embarrassing! The huge burger was one of the best he ever had. The fries were cut like potato half slices. They were very crisp and delicious,too. My gyro was in a pillowy soft pita with perfectly seasoned, tender lamb, topped with tzatziki, cucumbers, tomatoes onions and shredded lettuce. It was so delicious that I ate the whole thing. I chose the Greek salad as my side dish - it didn't disappoint. Chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, feta on shredded lettuce with a delicious dressing. While we were eating, Irenie, the owner came over and was teasing us about the broken ketchup bottle. She proceeded to clean it up herself. Very impressive. She was quite entertaining and engaging. In spite of the mishap, we were treated very nicely. We can't wait to return and try some different dishes. Perhaps Memorial Day weekend.",4.5,1
"The Aegean was recommended by the hotel we stayed at.  The food and service were fine but the margarita was terrible, cheap domestic wine, and poor atmosphere.  Sat on porch adjacent to outside dining where door kept opening to the cold outside.  For $100 including 1 terrible margarita and 1 glass a wine, the place is over priced and over rated.  At a minimum they could have made some price adjustment for the margarita.",4.5,1

"This is really not great Greek food. The Greek salad was overdressed with a heavy dressing and meager feta crumbles unsteady of hearty chunks. My medium rare lamb was well done, the shrimp in garlic butter sauce was overdone and tough, and although the taste was good, there wasn't any sauce to enjoy with the tasty pita.  On the good side, the fresh veggies were not over cooked, the felafel was well spiced and there was a great singer entertaining on the patio.",1.0,0
The waitress had no manners. We had problems with our orders. You were given the wrong tables entrée. The sole dish had no flavor. The Greek salad was soaked in balsamic vinaigrette with no seasoning. Overall the food was flavorless. We ordered drinks and they never came. The table next to ours had problems with their food not coming out as well and their waitress practically abandon them. Highly don't recommend this place. If you are looking for Mediterranean food I highly recommend NAJI - Lebanese food with way better Greek salad hummus and baba ghanouj and SERVICE!TERRIBLE service.  FLAVORLESS. DON'T waste your time and money going here!,2.0,0
"Came here because it was the only place open later on a Saturday night (til 10pm) and we had never been. The food was okay, not the best Greek food I've had.  We ordered the fried calamari which was okay and the saganaki as appetizers. I ordered the lamb kebab which wasn't great and my friends ordered the moussaka which was okay and spanikopita. The server came back after we had ordered and told us they were out of one of the spanikopita (you'd think they would know that ahead of time) and as a staple at a Greek restaurant they shouldn't be out of this. It is quite pricey and the wine list leaves a lot to be desired.",5.0,1
What a wonderful breakfast we all had today. Never in my life have I had such a delicious omelette served over pita bread with tzatziki. It is a must try if you have never tried it.

Thank you to everyone.,3.0,0
"Meh! Meh! Meh! The food was adequate but nothing special. I remember when this place served truly great food. Perhaps it was because we went before the ""season"" began, but it seemed dreary in comparison to other meals I've had there. Everything was pre seasoned with black pepper (which I am highly allergic to) and they had few choices for me on their menu as very little was cooked to order. Before the season starts, I recommend they upgrade their kitchen situation and give the place a good scrub!",4.0,1
"Very friendly service, attentive and well prepared Greek food. Full bar and nice selection of wines.

We're always looking for new places to try in Great Barrington and thought, why not.I was really in the mood for souvlaki, but alas it was not on the menu the night we dined. We ordered the octopus for an appetizer. For entrees I had a lamb shish kabob, he had stuffed peppers. Neither one of us was impressed with the entrée. The octopus was good but kind of bland. The lamb was very tough and lacked seasoning.Pretty expensive for what it is. Food does not live up to the hype.",4.5,1

"Food bland and un-interesting.  Waitress was indifferent at best.  We were one of only two parties in the entire restaurant, so it wasn't because she was too busy.Upon arrival, we were served pita bread that was ""toasted"", but actually burned around the edges, with a few tasteless olives.  The meal that followed was disappointing, to say the least.",4.0,1

"We had a mixed experience here.  We were seated in a comfortable, quiet booth with a great view outside.  Waitstaff were very friendly but inexperienced and inattentive after serving us.  We were not given any bread (or the olives mentioned)  until we asked for it when our appetizer arrived. Our appetizer order for ""octopus"" became ""hummus"" by the time it hit the kitchen and after receiving the wrong order, we had to wait another 20 minutes for the octopus (delicious but very small portion for the price). If we had been told that it had not even been cooked yet, we would have ordered something else.   As a result,  our main courses were sitting under the warmer for a long time.  My husband's lamb chops were still excellent but the tomato/onion topping on my sole plaki was burned black and the fish dried out  (also no observable ""lemon olive dressing"" as described).  I mentioned this to the waitress and she smiled, shrugged and said ""sorry"".  The owner, Irene, was very friendly, so we mentioned this to her tactfully (because it  was such a nice and friendly restaurant).  She also just shrugged and said somehing like ""but it was only the onions on top"", rather than, say, offering a dessert or something in recompense for their mistakes (we are both restaurant people, so have some experience with these situations).  Another minor complaint:  there were no prices listed on the liquor menu nor the dessert/coffee/after dinner menu so I had to ask about everything we wanted to order.  When I commented on this, the waitress and owner again shrugged it off.  In summary, we would go there again but perhaps stick to grilled main courses and simple, prepared mezes.",3.5,1

The Spicy Astorian has a deceiving description. It was far from spicy and the roast beef was barely cooked. The Feta and pepperoncini made it tolerable. The New York Strip Steak was massively under cooked and bland. It came with a side of Mediterranean rice that was cold and flavorless. Our experience was less than satisfying.

"If you're looking for an authentic Greek cuisine experience with a divine atmospheric setting, this place is the one! You can relax, dine in, or sit at the bar and grab a few glasses of wine-they have a huge collection. I visit here every time I am in town with my partner (who is Greek)  it's one of our favorite spots, and they really do treat us like family. Not to mention that the decor chosen for the place is super elegant, you will be surrounded by antique metal works, stone walls, and a fire place that warms up your spirits!One evening I stopped by the place when I  recently had my wisdom teeth removed, I came in starving, and was disappointed that I couldn't order my usual dishes like their octopus or steak, however, I got to try their avgolemono (chicken lemon soup) and their lamp soup and I really fell in love as they are now added to my new go-to dishes! Must try: avgolemono, char grilled calamari or octopus or any entree char grilled!, grilled baby lamp chops, and of course their spinach pie.",2.0,0
"Probably the worst meal I've had in years. Highly recommended by the inn where we stayed, but we can't for the life of us figure out why. The food was tasteless, seasonless, saltless. The fried zucchini and eggplant had absolutely no seasoning at all and the accompanying tzaziki was a lump of plain yogurt. Horrible!  The augelomono was decent as was lamb shish-kabob but the salads were lettuce and vinegar-no seasoning a crumb or two of Feta. The Flounder with onion and tomato was inedible. It was fishy tasting and bland and unseasoned with a tasteless tomato sauce smothering it. Disgusting. I see there are other such reviews. Too bad the chef is not reading them. Maybe he'd pick up a salt shaker. Oh and the prices they charge are ridiculously high for this bad diner food.",4.5,1
"We stopped in by chance for a late lunch  while traveling through Great Barrington.  We both had different salads with grilled calamari.  The calamari was cooked to perfection, tasty & tender.  The salad was large enough for a dinner. The dressing & greens were perfect.  Waitress was friendly and very attentive, although we were the only customers due to the off hour. The atmosphere was very pleasant & tables & bar were meticulously set. The outdoor dining looked lovely but it was a little too chilly to eat outside today.  Gardens & grounds are beautiful, I would imagine it would be a nice outdoor dining experience.",4.5,1

"On a winter afternoon a little bit of Greece is enticing--even if it's in Massachusetts.  The Aegean Breeze is on the well-traveled  Route 183 in Great Barring ton and is simply a great place to eat.The interior combines wooden beams, warm beach sand brown on the walls, wrought-iron sconces, and a working fireplace, with framed photographs of Greece and doors painted a striking blue.  The owner and Greek chef George Cami has not only brought Mediterranean ambiance but also authentic Greek cuisine to the area.My husband shared spoonfuls of the Traditional Greek Lemon Flavored Chicken Soup he ordered with me as the room filled with customers and conversations.  I had a Homemade Spanakopitta  and Bill had Mousaka.  Both are common Greek dishes that we've had in many restaurants and also made at home but at The Aegean Breeze they had a unique earthy fresh flavor.  Of course, we finished with Baklava with the same rich characteristics.The Aegean Breeze is on the way to one of our favorite art movie theaters so we'll definitely be stopping there many more times.",3.0,0
"This place is pretty meh. Maybe I ordered the wrong food, but I just wasn't impressed. We had a reservation for our big group of 10 and were seated in the upstairs dining room which doubled as the restaurants computer office. It was nice to be in our own room for a group that big, but it didn't seem like the waitress was all that pleased about helping us, and she gave off a very rushed vibe.Most of the food looked pretty good, I sampled the Aegean Scallops which were fantastic (when you have a dish named after the restaurant it better be!). I split a few things with the girlfriend: baked stuffed shrimp, mussels, and spanikopita. Only the spanikopita impressed me, but mostly because it was big on the filling and not so much on the filo, which was good (I hate getting a dish that's just overpowered by the dough). Other than that everything was just alright.I think everyone enjoyed their meal and our time there, but there are plenty of other restaurants I want to try and would frequent before I came back to Aegean Breeze.",4.0,1

"I have eaten at Aegean Breeze several times through the years and always leave feeling satisfied.  Our most recent visit was a positive experience.Don't go to Aegean Breeze expecting typical Greek menu.  They are at their best when you order items grilled (whole fish, octopus, meats).This is not a cheap restaurant and it has some flaws.  Notably tonight the waitress seemed indifferent to us.  Plates were not cleared, water glasses filled only after getting their attention.  This is not an inexpensive restaurant.  Our bill for 2 adults and a child was $65, excluding tip (no wine or beer).We came for the food and were not dissapointed.  My 4 year old had pita grilled cheese and Greek fries (lots of oregano, $4.95).  She was picky about the grilled cheese, but did a good job on her fries.  They did not have apple juice, she settled for pineapple (juice not included with the meal).My wife and I shared a plate of calamari.  For $11 I expected a pile, what we got barely covered the plate.  It was a good fry and the tomato salsa they served was good and full of herbs.My wife had a casserole of scallops, fresh tomatoes, feta and mushrooms ($22.95).  The menu said it came with rice/ potato and veggi, but she only got a veggi.  It needed rice to compliment the flavorful sauce.I ordered the lamb kabobs ($18.95).  I asked for the meat to be pink and was not dissappointed.  The meat had a nice char, but needed more seasoning.The veggies were awesome.  Huge chunks of zucchini, onions, celery and lots of herbs. They came in a separate serving dish and we noticed how little oil was left.I don't think many locals eat here.  The crowd on a summer Sunday evening was heavy on New York tourists who probably thought the place was inexpensive.",5.0,1

"""The grilled octopus was divine,"" is how I would start a review of this restaurant. I ordered the red snapper with mixed vegetables because I didn't think I had room for an appetizer and an entree. The fish was so wonderful that it got me wondering how was the octopus. I ordered it thinking that I could get a to-go box for any leftovers. I ordered an appetizer instead of a dessert but when they brought the dish and I started eating . . . I could not put down my fork and stop eating until it was gone from my plate. Excellent meal, enjoyable service and a delightful setting.",5.0,1

So we had an interesting experience: our appetizers were amazing. We had fried eggplant and the saganaki. Dinner was a mixed bag. The sardines were amazing. The moussaka was a bit bland but my lamb stew was really disappointing. I couldn't even eat it. It lacked flavor and the presentation was unappealing. It was not at all what I was expecting from a stew served over rice. When the dishes were cleared no comment was made about the basically untouched food. I commented to my companions that this was odd but ok whatever. But then the chef came over to talk to us about why we hadn't eaten the stew and left so much of the moussaka. He was concerned. He offered to remove the stew from our bill but we refused that offer. I explained my issues. He listened. He brought us a tasty dessert. I appreciate this. I plan to return; and I write off one poor meal as just a poor choice of entree. Service was great so don't be put off... just don't order the lamb stew.,2.0,0

They accepted a reservation and deposit and didn't even have enough seats for the group (several had to sit at the bar to eat), they served several people on paper plates with plastic forks and coffee in Styrofoam cups with plastic straw stirrers because they didn't have enough dishes nor silverware for the group.  They said they would serve a salad, followed by a choice of meal.  When it came, it was a piece of meat (very tiny on some plates) and salad all on one plate-nothing else, not even any bread.

"This restaurant was a real find!While overnighting in Great Barrington this week, I had occasion to discover what is one of those rare jewels these days......an authentic, family-operated restaurant displaying cooking from the ""old country"".Georgos and Elleni are the owner-operators, with George doing the chef duties and his wife serving as the hostess.The restaurant is cleanly and friendly, and the atmosphere is quite pleasant.They were raised on the Greek island of Corfu, and came to the States in the 1990's. Georgos has been the chef at the Aegean Breeze since 2000 I learned from our waitress and had taken over the business in 2015. The chef's special that I enjoyed was stuffed peppers. They were done to perfection, with a spiced blend of ground meat and rice in tomato base, topped lightly with mouth-watering feta cheese. On the side were the house specialty lemon roasted potatoes. After enjoying the complimentary pita bread with olive oil and calamata olives, I could hardly finish the bountiful meal.If you find yourself visiting the Berkshires, I'd definitely recommend a side-trip to visit this great value in dining.

"Except for the time with our friends, this entire restaurant experience was a disappointment.The pita with olives and olive oil on the table was a nice touch, but the olives seemed to be canned -- nothing special.  And even Bertucci's puts flavoring in their olive oil.The waiter was very nice but the service was seriously slow.  It took over an hour to get our meals, and then the appetizers were brought out after the entrees. My husband and I ordered two vegetarian dishes, making it clear that we were vegans and wanted no cheese.  The pasta looked and tasted as if it had been sitting under the hot lights for an hour, and the sauce tasted canned.  The appetizer plate had no feta, as requested, but the eggplant had cheese bits in it, and we wouldn't have trusted the mashed potatoes.

"2 and 1/2 stars. The Aegean Breeze used to be a great place to go and my family would always go here to celebrate. George, the owner/chef is a great chef but the food isn't as good as it used to be, perhaps he isn't in the kitchen as much. The waitstaff and atmosphere are horrible now. If you asked me two years ago where to go for a great meal out in Great Barrington with a diverse menu I'd instantly have told you to come here. Now, they pay no attention to the climate control and the lighting, and the servers are substandard at best. The vibe isn't the same as it used to be;it was warm and happy. Unfortunately the acoustics in the room facing the street have always been bad, as you can hear other peoples conversations loud and clear, but when the service and rest of the atmosphere was much better a couple years back, it was worth a couple loud people to enjoy a fine meal. The food is good, not as great as it used to be and George and his wife are wonderful kind people. I just had such a negative experience the last time I ate here I'm not going to waste my time and money coming back because the service and atmosphere were so bad.",3.0,0
"It's pretty good food, feels like the menu should be a bit more diverse given the fact that it's Greek cuisine. Haven't necessarily had a bad meal here but have never been blown away. The bar area is really nice with the wine bottles and everything. I would probably be more inclined to stop here regularly for cocktails but not for full meals. Given the cost of eating here, I'd rather spend $60-70 elsewhere in town where I know it will be better.",5.0,1
"Very inviting interior with a knowledgable, well trained staff that will treat you to a fantastic meal from their extensive menu. Indoor or Outdoor seating is available. We have eaten in a number of other Greek restaurants, and this one was truly top notch. Menu consists of a variety of many Greek specialties plus a lot of fish entrées and char-broiled options. The grilled scallops were divine! Spanakopita was authentically prepared and delicious. Wide variety of healthy choices on the children's menu. Service was attentive and timely. We enjoyed After-Dinner-Drinks and Desserts after a fabulous meal. Highly recommended if you are in the area.",4.0,1
"A regular dinner stop for me with the family or for business. Always friendly staff, great food, good prices and nice atmosphere. The Calamari is perfect, fantastic Lamb Kabob and Lamb Stew. The rice and also the lemon potatoes are always perfectly cooked and very tasty. Getting hungry writing the review.",4.5,1
"Went there recently and had a great meal!  The staff was super friendly ... the saganaki appetizer was delicios, and our lobster was cooked perfectly.  My only complaint was that, being married to a Greek, the lemon potatoes were disappointing.  I've had better... All in all, however, I would recommend this place!",5.0,1
First time at this place--almost rustic inside w/ a large glass enclosed area in the front.  We had a hard choosing entrees from all the terrific choices--ended  up w/ chicken Santorini and grilled (large) anchovies.  Both were absolutely delicious!  We plan to revisit often.,5.0,1
"My friend recommended this spot as one of her favorite places to eat so I brought my GF there recently.  One of the best Greek restaurants I've been to, hands down.  I loved their Hummus so much I took an order to go as well. I started off with hummus, Greek fries and Octopus. Everything was so good and the octopus literally just melts in your mouth unlike some places where you have to chew it for hours. She got the spinach pie, kalamata olives and chicken soup. It was nice to see her eyes swell with pleasure when she took her first bite of the pie & soup.  I'm not a soup guy but she made me try some and it was so tasty. We then split an order of lamb chops that il never forget. They were cooked medium rare as we had ordered them and they were so good. I ate most of the lamb so she had room for dessert. She went with the Greek yogurt and loved it. Lovely ambience, spotless restaurant  and very clean bathrooms (which is very important to me).  Hate it when you walk into a nice restaurant and the restroom is worse than a rest stop on the mass pike . Definitely  going back to this place.",2.0,0
I have to agree it is not worth the price. I have had better in some local diners in  N.J.  Service was so-so.  Maybe it is a hit or miss place.,1.0,0
I have been to the Aegean Breeze three times over the past few years and each time I go with high hopes that things have improved but they have not-- I always leave disappointed in the food and the service. Last night I took out of town friends who wanted to try it and was mortified at the end of the meal. The service was indifferent and when there were problems with our order the waitress couldn't care less. The menu is impressive but the food was pretty bland and either overcooked or old and dry.  All in all it was a bad and expensive experience. I can only assume that the owner is never around and the staff doesn't really care much about food or hospitality. The do a good job of hanging out at the bar though. My pasta dish was huge but the chicken in it was horrible. Ditto for my cousin's pasta with salmon. The spinach pie was so dry it was probably cooked last month and re-heated. The salads were soggy. The grilled fish was dry and luke warm. The waitress errors were our problem. I love good Greek food so I keep trying but I fear that I must now give up on this place.,3.0,0
we ordered 3 lamb gyros to go. they came w greek salads or fries. we opted for the salads. Kinda small but tasty. we  were kind of in a rush so she had our order done in less than 10 minutes. the gyros were just ok. & they weren't cheap. $12. each. I would give this place another chance probably for a sit down dinner because the other reviews are so good.,4.0,1
"a very friendly, pleasant moderate  to expensive priced restaurant with all the standard greek fare, and a few surprises, all tastefully done",4.5,1
"The burgers and fries here are a step above what you will find at even a fine restaurant. The incredibly scrumptious burgers cooked to order. They clearly use high quality beef and prepare it on the spot.Also, be sure to have the parmesan-truffle oil potato fries that will knock your socks off!  (Sandals off?). Every bite is incredible.My recommended hack is to order the sirloin burger but ask for the jam from the Box Burger. What a combination! The jam is the perfect condiment and should not be forgotten.I am told that the falafel burger is also fantastic for vegetarians in your group. But get the burger if you can stand to do so. It is worth the calories.As others say, do be prepared to wait.  Or, show up just before noon when the lines are shorter.An outdoor backyard is a fun place where your kids and dogs can run around. They even provide a frisbee for fun.",5.0,1
"We LOVE it here! It's 100% worth the wait in line. The best time to go is the middle of the week on a sunny day. You can set out a blanket and relax while you wait for your food and have a little impromptu picnic. You can also sit at the picnic tables and take some time to play frisbee or cornhole. The staff working definitely enjoy what they do and that really shows in the food that they produce.Our go-to is the Box Burger, chili cheese fries, and occasionally their Turkey wrap. The portions are great and the food is always fresh and it's worth every penny. If you get the chance, go!",5.0,1
Another amazing visit to The Bistro Box.... Waiting in line stinks but just shows the love for this awesome roadside place. Definitely worth the wait... the box burgers are perfectly made to order with the delicious bacon jam and spread is perfectly done! The onion rings are soooo crispy and yummy with the dipping sauce or just ketchup or both! The chicken wrap was amazing and the chicken salad box was a delightful thing of beauty. The ambiance wether you sit in your vehicle in the shade to enjoy your feast or at one of the highly coveted picnic tables is perfect... if you run out of beverage they have a nice water dispenser that is cold and refreshing near the condiment and tray return area. Free Wi-Fi while you eat or post mad selfies from this fun roadside eatery. We will be back for more in the near future...,5.0,1

"The amazingness of the delightful roadside stand transports you to a lovely place in a nice green clearing with trees, blue skies, good friends and the feeling of a family barbecue with next level tasting food! The care put into the food made and the presentation is so beautiful and enjoyable. Bring family or friends and just relax at the picnic tables or in your vehicle if it is packed and enjoy the ambiance and the most marvelous smells wafting through the air from the grill... My friend and I rejoiced at our beautiful lunch we received today and enjoyed every last crumb... We ordered the steak and cheese, onion rings (so crispy and perfectly seasoned) , the box burger ( which the bacon jam is to die for), the all beef hotdog (one of the best tasting grilled to perfection), a chocolate milkshake, and a old school bottled root beer.",5.0,1
It's a lovely Fall day for lunch with friends under the pine trees down here in Great Barrington.. met my friends for a nice outdoor picnic lunch at the Box. Weather was a wee bit chilly but the sun shine was beautiful and warmed our hearts as we met up at one of the lovely picnic tables in the grassy area. We had our electronic buzzers and drinks as we caught up on recent events and what we have been up to as we waited for our food.  The food smelled amazing and looked gourmet... see photos lol  Everything was so delicious and flavorful... these folks are real deal chefs and make awesome food for a little roadside place.... Sooooo awesome!!!! Great lunch excellent food and a super awesome experience having a Fall picnic.,5.0,1
"Beautiful picturesque day in South County... we decide to have lunch outside. The Bistro Box is perfect....beautiful view of the area and lots of trees and green.. you order and they do have a lot of menu items and drinks to choose from plus amazing icecream as well. The people who are super friendly, give you a buzzer so there is no annoying intercom calling out. Then you choose a nice picnic table and sit under a small grove of large trees and enjoy your lunch outside in the beautiful air. Easy off road and easy back onto road. Great spot for an afternoon snack, meal or dessert. The food is delicious,  recommend the burgers, grilled cheeses, and pretty much all the specials I have tried our delightful to the tastebuds. Fries are hot and crisp and have options of toppings.Stop by and give it a try.",5.0,1
"This is one of my absolute favorite places to eat in the summer. A small place open only during the warm months. I recommend getting there when they open because as the day goes on the line gets very busy. The wait time can be long. All of their food and drinks are amazing! They also offer ice cream! They have lots of tables out back, along with corn hole and connect four. I highly recommend!!",5.0,1
"Great place to stop for some quality food. Stopped by on Friday at 1230 and waited in line for 20 minutes to order and get our food and drinks. Found a table in the shade to enjoy our lunch and the views. Seemed kid friendly, clean port-o-pot. Reasonably priced, good service. Recommended!",5.0,1
"This roadside stand in a meadow off the highway around Great Barrington is a must stop for us. Not because it's the cheapest spot around (it's not!) ... or that it has the best food. We like it because the food is consistently good ... and the flavours are on point. It's kind of like In N Out Burger on the west coast. The consistency and overall goodness make you rave about it.Each time I go here, I try to convince myself to try something new. They have specials, which they post to their social media accounts ... and they have a regular menu. Everything is fresh, local (where possible) and made from scratch ... sauces, meats, breads, etc.I ordered the steak and cheese sandwich with a side of onion rings. Over $20 for that ... a sandwich and a side. It came out looking tiny ... no way was this going to make me feel full, I thought. But, it was one of the best steak and cheese sandwiches I have had. (And we're talking after many trips to Philly.) The cheese sauce was homemade and gooey and mixed in with the shaved steak, peppers and caramelized onions, which were the star of the show. The onions were so sweet and done perfectly that, as 'The Dude' would say, 'They ... like ... really tied the sandwich together, man.'The onion rings were lightly battered ... crisp outside and soft inside and perfectly seasoned. Salty, crunchy and full of flavor. They did not make me feel bloated or gross after eating them and the chipotle mayo dipping sauce they came with was perfection. Don't sleep on the onion rings.The gf got the Falafel sandwich. It was good ... but she had serious order envy after trying a bite of my steak and cheese. Being a gentleman, I offered to split it with her but I was relieved when she said no. The Falafel was really good and crisp and flavourful ... but the star of the show was the steak and cheese and the smash-style burgers. The homemade pickles were the best part of the Falafel sandwich.They have Adirondack chairs, corn hole games and frisbees for use before or after lunch. Note that everything is made to order, so it takes time to be served. On a summer or early fall day ... prepare for a line/long wait. We went on Halloween and there were only 6 other people in line, which meant a 10 minute wait. We had no room for dessert but, although what we ordered wasn't exactly health food, it didn't leave us feeling sluggish and bloated. 70% of the time when I order a burger, I leave regretting it as is feels like a rock in my stomach.Overall, while a bit pricey ... this is a must stop when it is open in season. The food is very good ... the hipster vibe is strong but so are the flavours and the reviews. Go the extra few miles to eat lunch here ... it's consistent and well worth the trip.",5.0,1

"Well -- the food itself is delicious.  Gotta love great burgers, dogs, salads and specials.  Whether it's a juicy burger or a grilled chicken sandwich .. it never disappoints.  Their truffle parmigiano fries are killer.  Sometimes there are such long lines we just drive right by - and wait for a rainy day.  So if you don't mind waiting to order -- and the again to get your food ....stop by.  They have water for dogs. The garden out back is lovely.Keep an eye out for fun specials",4.0,1
"This place was so yummy!! I got there and I was the very last customer of the day. They close the line at 3:30 because there is so many people in line already and they close close at 4. I waited 40 minutes but it didn't matter because it was definitely worth the wait. The truffle fries were amazing! So much truffle oil, crispy, and the perfect amount of Parmesan.! The panini and burger were also so good, moist, and cooked to perfection. The cashier, Bridget, always had a smile on her face and was such a pleasant person! She makes anyone coming to this place feel like family! The outside had a bunch of games to play and gave off such a relaxing vibe. I will definitely be coming back!",5.0,1
Amazing. Incredible. Wow. Just wow. Life changing. The mint chip ice cream is great too. I've been there twice and had hot dog and Parmesan fries with truffle oil both times. Always a huge line though which is the only downfall but well worth it. Also a big lawn and they supply frisbees.,5.0,1
"A bit of a line, but worth the wait. Food came out quickly, the people who worked there were nice, food was delicious, and the atmosphere is nice. They had heaters set up which is a nice touch too. Grilled chicken sandwich and regular fries were good (fries on the side is a generous portion, the non side portion was huge). My friend liked her burger as well.",5.0,1

"How long are you willing to wait to order food? Not get it - just order it.5 minutes? 10 minutes? 20 minutes? How about 35 minutes? That's standing in line - in the sun - just to put in my order. And oddly, when I finally got to the one window and one person taking orders, it only took me about 90 seconds to order, pay and get a beverage. So why did it take so long? Why did it take some customers 3-6 minutes to place their order? I haven't a clue. I will say this: My burger, onion rings, lemonade plus an order of gazpacho with tax and tip came to a grand total of $42. And that's for one person. After I finally did order, the wait for the food was about 10 minutes or so. So it takes 3x times to wait to order the food than it does to cook the food? Got to say, that's a bit weird. When the food did come, I'd rate it about 5 out of 10. The burger was fine; though nothing special at $14+ and it doesn't come with anything other than a couple of pickle slices. The onion rings were standard issue, lacked seasoning and a bit on the small side - they do come with a small cup of dipping sauce. The gazpacho at $7 wasn't good at all - swimming in olive oil (which in fairness is mentioned on the menu but the consistency was off.) My lemonade was fine. I like the idea of this place but the execution leaves much to be desired along with the porta-jon bathrooms behind the building for those patrons who absolutely cannot wait - and I recommend you not use them on a hot day. This place reminds me of Captain Jack's in Easthampton, MA - another roadside ""joint"" that gets lots of accolades and rave ratings for what I think is a very mediocre experience (you can read my review on my horrid experience there.) I've been up and down Route 7 many times and wanted to stop and try Bistro Box but my former companion wouldn't have it because she's a pain in the butt about fried food but now that I have been there I can thankfully cross it off my ""bucket list"" and never return again.",2.0,0
"The food is incredible here. Box burger, French fries always perfection BUTThey need to stop closing their line so early. I understand the line gets very long and closing early allows them to serve those currently in line up to 4pm.HOWEVER, we arrived BEFORE 3pm, over an hour before 4pm closing time, with the line no more than 5 groups (much shorter than peak), yet they had someone standing with the closed sign already.If you want to close by 3pm, then put your hours as closing at 3pm. But please do not inconvenience your customers by closing OVER AN HOUR before your stated hours. Not right.",3.0,0
"The line was as expected, an hour. It wasn't too bad since the music added a nice element to the wait and the views were beautiful. Order took about 3 minutes and came with a smile and one of those beeper things. We waited maybe 10-15 minutes for the food. It came out hot and looking gorgeous. Portions huge!! Def needed more family members or friends to help. Fresh lemonade, falafel burger, truffle fries and corn were insanely good. Like best I've had! Grilled cheese was also good but like it's grilled cheese. :) My mom had the butter pecan ice cream she said it was also good. Can't wait to return and try something different on the menu!",5.0,1
"Top summer pick.  Actually, top all-time pick thanks to Yelp.   The truffle fries were the best we have ever had...better than at any top restaurant.  Loaded with the most flavorful parmesan, not too much oil or salt and perfectly cooked.  Huge portion.  Burgers I was told by the guys were 'great'... I did not try. My Asian salad was THE best I've ever had.  Freshest ingredients as just picked at a farm and delicious dressing.     Games for kids to play during the wait.  We are going to take a day trip back up to GB just to have this delicious food again l    Photo to come..",5.0,1

"It's hit or miss with BB. At its best, it's a five out of five. At its worst, it's a two out of five. I've gone early to be first in line only to get what was obviously an old burger from the night before that tasted horrible and was 100% overcooked. I've gone mid-service only to wait 55 minutes to place an order with only 10 people ahead of me. Do the math. That 5+ minutes per order. It's insane how long it takes to get to the order window! The cashier also does the specialty drinks and it takes a lifetime. Once you get your order in, you only have a 5-10 minute wait. The kitchen has to notice they only get 1 order every 4-6 minutes. You must have no less than 90 minutes to spare if you plan to eat there. I wouldn't bring kids and I wouldn't go if you can't stand in the sun for a long period of time. We finally got our meals today and had to shove the burgers down and ditch the fries bc we were late. We only allowed 1hr and that was no where near enough. It's a shame bc the burgers were excellent today but we couldn't enjoy them all because of a delay in ordering.",3.0,0

"This place is so freakin' good. I am basically red meat-free at this point, except for the occasional Box Burger because they are just that good. The sweet, tangy tomato jelly makes me wonder why we even use ketchup on burgers traditionally.

Such a fun, fulfilling meal in the Berkshires.",5.0,1

Large portions and great to share- they don't have much seating but it's very casual with outdoor picnic tables and many people eating out the back of their cars. It's not fancy but it's fun, and the view of the mountains added even more to the experience!

"The skin-on fries slathered in shack-made chili and cheddar ale sauce is probably the best $6 I've spent in the past 18 months.Seriously, incredible food is getting cranked out of this highway-riding Bistro Box. It's the MasterChef version of carnival pop-ups - hot dogs made with grass-fed local beef and topped with Holla Hill's crimson kraut, salted caramel toffee ice cream churned blocks away in Maple Valley, toasties that give Instaworthy cheese pulls, a slammin' gazpacho, and did I mention those fries?Get the fries - as a $3 side, or gussied up and doubled in size. Fresh herbs and garlic, truffled parmesan, or the aforementioned (and highly, HIGHLY recommended) chili cheese, any of these applications are going to be meals unto themselves at $5-6 each.How can food this tremendous be this cheap? I mean, the Box Burger is the most expensive thing on the menu, and that grass fed, cheddar topped, bacon jam and roasted garlic aioli slathered beaut just barely exceeds $10.Is it people? AM I EATING PEOPLE? Don't care; time for seconds.All seating is outside, and there's usually a fast moving line. Great for groups, most def, so order up, stake out a picnic table, grab a Frisbee or play some cornhole, and preemptively loosen your belt. You're about to be one satisfied cannibal.",5.0,1
"I kinda love this place! Adorable side of the road shack serving up some all American tasty burgers and sammies, delicious fries in a variety  of flavors, homemade lemonade, soup of the day, a few packed salads,Virgil's natural sodas and locally made ice cream. It's picnic style dining with some tables or you can even bring a blanket and really picnic! There's an entire open grassy backyard with lawn games including corn-hole, lawn dice and frisbee. Such a chill atmosphere! Dylan, Hendrix and Stevie Ray were bumping over the loud speaker so waiting in the long, but swiftly moving line to order wasn't too bad. After ordering we were given a buzzer and our food was really ready in no time. Soups and drinks were given immediately and they do open up a seperate line for ice cream. We started with delicious refreshing Arnold Palmers and the lemonade of the day which was blueberry. Complimentary water for both humans and furry friends is available to the left of the shack were the trash cans are located. :) We tried the soup of the day which was a creamy mushroom bisque for $6 served with traditional New England oyster crackers. It had load of meaty mushrooms at the bottom and was very well liked with all who tasted it. Fried pickles and parmesan truffle oil fries were our sides. There are about 4 different tempting varieties of fries but this fam is a sucker for truffle oil! It was given generously and quite tasty. Perhaps more truffle oil than I've seen given at any fancy place in the city. Props for that!Hubs ordered the Roadside burger and wasn't overly impressed. He said the bun was the best part. Whomp whomp. The falafel burger on the other hand was scrumptious, and huge!We had an awesome time here and stayed a lot longer than we anticipated. A very laid back, uber chill environment. Perfect stop for a weekend away from it all. Everyone was friendly and overall the food (minus the burger) was really great!

"2 words... BOX BURGER. If you are a burger lover, I 200% promise you this is one of the absolute best burgers you will ever have. Don't change anything, don't add/take away anything, don't ask for tomatoes and lettuce... simply say ""I'll take the box burger""... if I could give this burger 1000000 stars I would. It does come with a few little pickles on the side which sometimes I throw on the burger for fun. Other than that, everything else is great too. I've had the caprese sandwich, Cuban, steak and cheese, breakfast burrito (2nd favorite thing), quesadilla, truffle fries (also a must) and many specials.

"Let me start by saying I am torn between 3 and four stars, and this is why. Very salty, everything is salty. Yes good  quality product. I had a very good burger and hand made onion rings. Burger was cooked to perfection, with all fresh ingredients.  The onion rings also cooked perfectly and a huge portion.  My problem aside from the salt is that, yes the portions are big but at over 6 dollars for onion rings, they should either offer a smaller size or show just how much you get. The prices are high and I understand you pay for what you get. But at over 20 dollars for a burger, onion rings and a soda that's a lot. A smaller size fries and onion ring would make a lot of sense.  Just my opinion and ohhh yes the salt wow just to much",4.0,1
"Love this fab find in the Berkshires!  Their menu is inventive and well designed for the contemporary traveler!  We had their Hebrew National hotdogs ... mine with sauerkraut.... on grilled buns!  The Chopped judges would love them!  The onion rings were perfectly done... crispy and hot..... not greasy!  We were given a buzzer wrapped in a plastic, and when I picked it up a few minutes later, it was perfectly packaged !  The order had been placed in a large brown bag!  The hotdogs were encased in a cardboard holder.... which was placed in a biodegradable box too!  The onion rings were served with a dipping sauce ... original and tasty... and they were wrapped in a red and white Cheeto box!  Definitely.... stop here!       The Bistro Box is a wonderful asset to the Berkshires experience in 2020!",5.0,1
"I arrived around noon on a Tuesday afternoon in mid-June and was the 7th person in line at the order window.  The wait was long.  I'm not sure what made each person spend so much time at the window but to move to the front, it took a little over 20 minutes.If you have the time to wait, I highly recommend you do because the food more than makes up for it.  I ordered the box burger and the chili-cheese fries.  Both were fantastic.  So good that the hour and 10 minute drive there won't stop me from going back and trying out the rest of the menu.",5.0,1
"We spent some time up in the Berkshires this week.. Outside of cooking at home, I took a trip with my father in-law and his friend to pick up something in town and we came across this place..   It's sits on a picturesque piece of land on the side of the road, next to the old racing track.. It's a little shed that houses the kitchen and grill and after receiving your food, you sit and eat on picnic benches..   The menu is pretty straight forward: They have a couple of salads, a couple of sandwiches and what seem to be the stars, burgers and dogs.. What I find interesting is, they have two kinds of burgers and two kinds of dogs.. One burger is a straight forward sirloin burger with Lettuce Tomato and Onion, the other is fancy beef, fancy tomato bacon compote and aioli.  The standard dog is Hebrew National, the other option is farm made Hot Dog..  They are priced accordingly.. I just liked having the option of either or and allowing the customer to decide what's important to them. I went with the regular sirloin burger and my father in-law and fried went Hebrew National.. As we are on the border of Mass, the dogs were on a NE Hot Dog Bun.. My burger was pretty decent.. The patty was nothing special but, the bun was surprisingly good.. The line moves slowly (handwritten orders)  but, the food comes out quickly..   Fries were really nice, I had the onion rings which were pretty good however, the dipping sauce the provided was tasteless and probably the most unhealthy thing on the table  ( i have not read much on nutrition)  But, for a Memorial Weekend spot, to hang out in the sun and mix with the locals, it was a very fun time.  I would recommend trying the fancy burger next time.",5.0,1
"In laws came in to visit so we drove up to the Berkshires for some leaf peeping. Drove by this place on the way home and decided to stop for lunch. We were not disappointed! It was delicious and speedy, and what a beautiful place on a nice day. The in laws each got the chicken sandwich, my husband got a steak sandwich and I got the Cubano. Everything was delicious. The fries were absolutely to die for! One order was plenty for the four of us to share. The lemonade was awesome too!",5.0,1
"One of the best burgers I've ever had, and I've had some great ones! Surprised to see the roadside foodshack location but came to love it. Ordered the box burger and blueberry lemonade. Lemonade tasted homemade,with muddled blueberries...awesome! As I waited for my burger I sat at the picnic table sipping my lemonade, I appreciated the unique location of the bistro box. A large sweeping field overlooked by mountains and a soundtrack of birds chirping and the occasional car rolling by.Soon enough I had my burger. A thick fresh patty,  perfectly seasoned, topped with a strong and delicious cheese,  salty bacon jam and placed in between a pillowy soft buttered roll.I live hours from this place and I can't wait for an excuse to go back.",5.0,1

"It pains me to give this place a one star because the food is beyond incredible, but on numerous occasions we've made plans to go here ( I live over an hour away ) and by the time we arrive they've already closed for the day.

"As longtime customers, we decided to stop by for a lemonade on a beautiful spring day. Aware that they closed at 4:00pm, we arrived at 3:40 and got in line. We were berated by a staff member twice from inside the kitchen for getting into line, as she yelled at us that they were closed (they were not) and we had to leave, yet telling the four people in front of us that they could stay. This experience was enough to reveal what this place is really about -- poor customer treatment alongside absurdly long wait times for overpriced food served from a shack on the side of the road. We are excited to bring our business elsewhere.",1.0,0
"Was in the area and my friend said she's been told she needed to try this place so we stopped in and were glad we did! The are a small walk up stand on the side of the road with picnic tables and lawn games. There was a couple playing corn hole, and another throwing a frisbee around. They have a metal jug for water, and a big water bowl for the dogs. I got a mint chip milkshake which was delightful and refreshing on a hot day. My friend got a raspberry lime ricky which was more of a smoothie than what it normally comes as but it was very good, a bit sweet, but refreshing. I got the pressed cuban and overall was good. The only critique is there was a bit too much dijon mustard for my liking. They did change out the cheese for me though even though there was a line. (They don't do any substitutions when busy) My friend got their special burger that had tomato bacon jam and caramelized onions....i WISH i got that instead because the bites i tried were amazing! Loved being able to sit outside and enjoy good food in a great atmosphere.",4.0,1
Delicious and great outdoor seating. Great for a day date in the warmer months. Had the pineapple coconut slush and pressed Cuban. Fried pickles and a very generous portion of fries.,5.0,1
Doesn't look like much from the road but the panini's and salads are scrumptious. There homemade lemonade is good too. Picnic tables in the back or bring a blanket and sit on grass.  Great music playing. Must be a hot spot tons of people stopping to eat. Just north of The Pass dispensary on east side. Outdoor bathrooms were clean.,5.0,1
The BOX burger is legitimately one of my favorite burgers I've had the pleasure of devouring in my almost 40 years of existence.  I'm not one who's prone to hyperbole & I really really like/love burgers.I wanted my patty cooked medium & was not disappointed.  The meat was juicy & fresh.  I'd recommend skipping the ketchup for this burger cuz it's not short on flavor with the tomato bacon jam.  Stuff is crazy tasty & downright magical.  I took one bite & knew that this was the burger that I'd judge all others by going forward in life.I split fries & onion rings with a friend.  Portions were crazy generous & two grown men could barely finish the onion rings with plenty of fries left over.  Our fries were long but not too thick.  They were inconsistently cooked with I really enjoyed.  Some were extra crispy & some just fluffy.  Just really awesome all around.  Two burgers with fries & onion rings set us back $30.  It's definitely unpretentious & they have a fairly diverse menu.  The only drawbacks I can imagine are that it's gotta get busy during the weekends around peak lunch/dinner times.  And they only have a port-potty.  It'd be cool if they served beer/alcohol but you could always sneak some BYOB if you're discreet.  If I didn't live 2 hours away in RI I'd probably eat here every week & not get sick of it.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes good food & burgers.  Family friendly too!,5.0,1

"Box burger bliss! After a strenuous hike at Monument Mountain, I could not bear to think of dining indoors on such a nice early summer day. I had passed The Bistro Box earlier in the day, and was taken by the bucolic setting. Thank you Kris W. for the compelling YELP review just days prior. Road side stand, picnic tables on an expansive lawn with beautiful mountain view as a backdrop.....perfect scene for a perfectly cooked (medium rare) grass fed burger... beefy salty and juicy on it's own, but the addition of well chosen condiments took this to the top... the tomato bacon jam on top of oozy aged cheddar was perfection. The grlic aioli excellent, but I did not want to blunt those extraordinary flavors, so I used it on one half my Caesar salad as a dressing. The Caesar was delicious, lettuce fresh and crisp, crouton crunchy and garlicky, perfectly ripe cherry tomatoes, shaved parmigiana and dressing on the side. The aforementioned picnic tables double as blackboards and colored chalk turns everyone into artists. There is a playground in the field, probably belonging to Bogeys next door, but kids ran across the field to play allowing parents a minute or two to savor the scene and their food!Pull off of Route 7 into the gravel lot, sit roadside or field side and enjoy a reminder of what roadfood used to be before places like this totally disappear.",5.0,1
"Must have been one of their off days. Certainly my burger was not cooked to order, as they claim. It was ready too soon for that. Flat, over cooked, on a soggy bun. Soggy fries too. Waste of money. I'll hope for better luck next time.",2.0,0
"Box burger is very good, though a bit expensive, excellent steak and cheese, good fried pickles.  The lemonade was so-so.",4.0,1
"This is the kind of place you want to fast before visiting. The Box Burger is hands down the best item on the menu, but the Cuban and the Steak and Cheese score high as well. Amazing fried pickles and various fries. And if you somehow still have room, they have excellent ice cream and shakes.The atmosphere is great too, with picnic tables and lawn games tucked out of sight of busy rt 7. It's a great spot to score some amazing food and play a game of corn hole on a sunny afternoon - other than the fact that you'll spend most of that time waiting in line. When the weathers nice the place gets packed, but they seem ill equipped to handle the crowds. A half hour wait is not uncommon. Once you order the food gets out pretty quick, but that's only if you don't collapse from heat stroke waiting in line. This is the only place the Bistro Box loses points. If you're just in it for the food, hit it when it's overcast.",5.0,1
"We had to stop based on these reviews!  It's so nice to see a seasonal spot not shutter it's doors mid September!  We got the roadside burgers, a fry, chili cheese fries and two lemonades.  The burger had great flavor but we both agreed on the dry side.  (The guy who took our order said he's usually on the grill so it could've been a less experienced griller?) The fries were addicting.  The chili was slightly sweet and a little chunky but not off putting since that's not my thing.  We thought it was a little pricey at $50 but we'd go back if we're in the area!",4.0,1

"So, I'm hiking the Appalachian trail and get to the route 7 intersection. It's one million degrees outside and water sources are scarce. I start walking towards Great Barrington when bam! Rich a former thru hiker yells out his window, ""Do you need a ride?"" Why, yes I do! ""Where do you wanna go?"" Somewhere with cold drinks. Maybe a milkshake. 1 mile or so later up the road and he's dropping me off at The Bistro Box. The sign says Ice Cream. I'm sold. Hmm... What to order? A normal burger for $7 or the BOX burger that has garlic aioli, tomato bacon jam and cheese for $10. The box it is. And a raspberry sorbet peach milkshake please. For here!So I'm hiking and like normally eating ramen and trail mix and bla bla so my expectations are low, right? Just please give me real food that doesn't get me sick. Well... Little did I know I was about to embark on one of the top 5 burgers and milkshakes I have had in my entire 27 years of life. Holy smokes, people. Buy stock. Get a franchise.

"This is perhaps the most unlikely eatery I have ever reviewed. Situated on the the roadside on the busy route 7. The stretch of highway is mainly for commercial stores and auto repair shops. So let's start with the ambiance. The kitchen is housed in an old roadside stand. That's it. Everything else is outside in broad meadow that features picnic tables and outdoor games. Order your food, find a table. While awaiting your order enjoy the simplicity of playing outdoors. Now the menu. Imagine every roadside favorite you enjoyed as a kid. Hot dogs? Hamburgers? Fried onion and potatoes? Home made lemonade? To this traditional fare add healthy soups and entrees and desserts.That's it..... it's a must see stop on your trip to the Berkshires. So get in the car, park and line up to purchase a great lunch. Make friends with your fellow diners on line, find a sunny picnic table and wait for your remote electric ""waitress"" calls you to pick up your purchase. See you there.",4.0,1
"Pretty damn good burgers and iced tea.  The BOX burger was flawless. Fries were decent, but lacked a crispness that would have been nice.Service was painfully slow.  Like stoner slow.  Friendly but stoner.  But part of the problem are the idiot customers who cannot make up their low IQ minds.  (If you're standing in line for 15 minutes, make up your mind!)There is a sign that suggests no exceptions or modifications.  Everyone ahead modified their order.  Pathetic customers.  The menu was designed well.  To continue my customer rant, If you have food allergies, phobias or dislike, cook and eat at home.   This baby behavior is getting lunatic.  Whiners.  To conclude, a second or third visit is necessary.",4.0,1

"The Bistro Box takes the classic New England roadside food shack and elevates it to Great Barrington levels of fanciness.  This is high end gastropub quality food at not much more than fast food prices.  Two excellent sandwiches and a huge order of fries will set you back about $20.  I had the Cuban, which is a well executed traditional take on the sandwich.  The fries are borderline perfect.  Crisp, hand cut, delicious.  My only complaints are that the fries could have had more salt on them (easily remedied) and that they could offer some aioli to dip them in instead of ketchup.",5.0,1

"The bistro box has really good food. They even have some good vegetarian options like a grilled cheese, and a falafel burger. My only complaint is it's pretty expensive. A family of four can spend $50 there, Which seems like a lot for roadside self-serve place. They're obviously doing something right, because there's always a long line to eat there!",4.0,1
I am rarely out in the Berkshires but a local recommended the Bistro Box to me on a recent visit. I ordered the Box Burger and it is the single greatest burger ever. It has ruined all burgers for me forever. The tomato bacon jam is the perfect mix of sweet and salty and the burger is nice and juicy. I would 100% recommend this place to anyone and if I get anywhere near the Berkshires I know where I'm going for lunch.,5.0,1

"The bistro box is a go to during the summer. Try to hit it on the week days though, long lines on the weekends. Can say that they never disappoint, if there is a problem they will make it right and fix it. Try their homemade pickles!!!!!",5.0,1
Amazing food!! This place is literally a road stop! But don't get discouraged the food is fantastic! I got he grilled chicken sandwich with rosemary aoili and my husband the steak sandwich. We also got a cream soda float. There are plenty of benches to sit outside with games to play. I will defiantly return here.,5.0,1
"Apart from the EXTREMELY RUDE STAFF, really good food, most of the time - sometimes it's served cold. Fast service. I frequent this place - having lunch about once a week, and routinely I have yet to visit when the staff have not been curt, rude, brusque and downright unpleasant. This past weekend I was so offended when I asked for my burger rare and was asked if it was for a dog, that I won't ever be back. I'll get my burgers and milkshakes elsewhere unless their staff are literally all replaced with friendly people instead of nasty jerks.",1.0,0
"Hi Rita! We remember this interaction clearly & would like to add a couple facts. First off, you ordered a turkey burger & asked for it extremely rare.  We asked if it was for a dog, which several customers do (not meant to be offensive) We just wanted to clarify that you knew it was poultry, as in general poultry should be fully cooked for safety.  We then apologized if we offended you in anyway, and you rolled your eyes at us. Sorry you had this experience, but we were just clarifying your request & in no way meant to be a 'nasty jerk'.",4.0,1
"Food was great. We got a chicken quesadilla minus chicken, French fries and the roadside burger with bacon and cheese. Strawberry lemonade was just ok. Parking was tight.

"We live in the area and have tried this place for lunch a few times. The burgers and fries are delicious.

Everything is made fresh. You can see the fries being freshly cut in the back. A really neat atmosphere for all ages. I recommend the flavored lemonades, Steak and Cheese and fries.",5.0,1
This is one of those roadside food stand that really represents taste and flavor of the Berkshires. Taking your taste buds back in time to a simpler time (like your child hood) times filled with no worries. Just a hot roadside Berger  And some of the most succulent bacon jam to top it all off.,5.0,1
I was deciding on a place and I've driven past this location before but never stopped. Today I decided to stop and it was the best decision I've ever made. The onion rings were insane. Best I have ever had. I got the Asian salad and chicken sandwich and both were amazing. Overall this place is the real deal and the best place in the area by far.,5.0,1
What can I say- other than I wish they were open all year round- the food is the best road side stand ever.,5.0,1

"This place has the best roadside food I've ever eaten. I hope they're here to stay! It seems like this roadside location has typically closed down and opened with new owners / business models every year or two. The Bistro Box is exactly what Great Barrington needs: Roadside, organic, gourmet food! I live about 2 miles from here and unfortunately don't have the chance to visit all that often. If I have one suggestion, it would be to extend the hours to 8 or 9PM for people looking for a later night eat!",4.0,1
"Awesome roadside eatery just a short drive outside of downtown GB. Great burgers, fries, ice cream, veggie friendly options, outdoor seating and a small shaded grassy area for playing games and hanging out. Always a welcome sign of spring when the Bistro Box reopens for the season. There are times where it's so packed the lines go out to the road, so time it well when you go there!",4.0,1

"All I can say is holy cow!  This place is phenomenal.  Not what you'd expect from a roadside burger stand. I think it's possibly one of the best burgers I ever had.  I had the box burger, my wife, the Tuscan panini. We shared truffle fries and onion rings. Only need one of them. The portions were huge. This food is great. We are definitely returning to try other menu items. It's outdoor eating, so if there is inclement weather, you're eating in your car.",5.0,1
"We love this place! Everything you'd hope a roadside eatery could be - quick, affordable, creative, and delicious. Their burgers are juicy and delicious, their onion rings are unmatched, and while it was only a one-day thing as far as I know, their lobster roll was one of the best I've eaten! Great spot with great energy.",5.0,1

incredible outdoor place to eat in great barrington. the box burger is world class.,5.0,1
"This place is great! It was recommended to us and I'm glad we went. The truffle fries were amazing - though let's be serious, anything with truffle oil is a win to me. I am a vegetarian and got the falafel burger which was great-- looked a bit like a veggie burger, but tastes like a falafel. I got it over lettuce instead of the bun which was good. My husband got the burger and liked it--the downside is that they cook it well done, so if you want less cooked you need to ask. It's very casual and laid back. You order at the counter and bring it to picnic tables. It's also great for families because they have a huge open grass field with frisbees to use. I would definitely come back here.",4.0,1
"What an awesome experience! Great food, burgers rock and the truffle fries?!...phenomenal. Roadside experience makes it casual and laid black. My daughter and her friend got blueberry lemonade which they enjoyed along with the Tuscan grill and quesadilla. Next time we'll try the ice cream...looks as good as SoCo.",4.0,1

"Wow.  Been wanting to go here for over a year, but the lines are always too long, or it is closed (everything here closes way too early).  Heard the burgers here are out of this world.  Finally got here a few days ago... line was not too bad... ordered a burger and fries in truffle oil with shaved parmesean cheese.  The burger was AMAZING.  So juicy.  I will now crave it way too much.  The fries were delicious... they are handcut and not too fried... but the serving was for two people, so I had to throw half of them away.  This place is a testament to the adage that if you serve good food and you price it well... people will flock to it.",5.0,1
"The cars and the lines at this seasonal roadside eatery are your first clue about the delicious offerings here! Serving up salads, sandwiches, burgers, shakes and fries, there's a unique twist on theses staples that has us returning over and over as well as making sure that new arrivals and visitors don't miss out.  I tend to repeat my order of the Box Burger and Parmesan Truffle Fries but others have praised the offerings such as the Falafel sandwich, salads and the shakes.  Their homemade lemonades are fresh and tasty.  On nice days you can sit outside at one of the picnic tables and play outdoor games such as horseshoes or corn hole.  Good food and good fun for the whole family. Check it out!",5.0,1

We love sitting at the picnic tables and our son loves the cornhole game and the vast lawn right behind the restaurant, great for running around, playing and burning off energy.  The lines to order can be somewhat long in the summer, but just make peace with it. You'd wait longer in a table service restaurant anyway. And it's so, so delicious.",5.0,1
"Without a doubt, the greatest surprise of gourmet road food I have encountered on Route 7, or anywhere else. A delectable, custom prepared burger, and freshly made lemonade.

The wrap is Vegan, they clearly entertain all food liberals, and I am thankful GF is not included with every Vegan option!The wrap had quinoa salad/kale AND a generous offering of hummus, Salad mix and tomato.The space is super welcoming and service is clearly marked, making the flow of ordering a breeze. They also have ample amounts of paper menus if you need an extra minute to choose.Sweets look fresh and shop made-the peach pie almost won me over this time....Beautiful job-outdoor seating is fun and whimsical for warmer days as well....",4.0,1

Great spot! Varied menu. had the curried chicken salad wrap which was very fresh and tasty. Reasonably priced. Didn't wait long for it to come out either. Left with a half caf coffee for the trip back which was very strong and hot.Def a place I'd stop again if I'm passing through Great Barrington!,3.0,0
"Servers are lovely, and the outdoor seating with wildflowers all around is much appreciated. Sadly, the menu here is just very boring for vegetarians and especially for vegans. For example, not a single sandwich is vegetarian (except a wrap). With a few tweaks, they could make it so easy to at least substitute a vegetarian protein for grilled chicken, or swap the burgers. Would love to see a chickpea version of the curry chicken salad. The arugula/quinoa bowl I had, with pickled vegetables, was a solid vegetarian option, pleasantly salty and tangy, but it lacked dimension - it needs something nutty, fatty or beany to round it out.",5.0,1
"We picked up sandwiches here to take to Tanglewood and they were fantastic! The exterior of the building was so beautifully landscaped. We ordered inside and waited outside for our order, told it would be at least 10 minutes, so we enjoyed the flowers. Our order was up ahead of schedule. The chicken club was thickly layered with very moist flavorful chicken pieces and delicious bacon. The chicken and avocado was as good. These were good-sized sandwiches. With prices about the same as Panera, I would definitely consider this a great deal!",3.0,0
"Needs improvement, especially with online ordering.We should be able to add lettuce and tomato to a burger (it should actually come standard, but it doesn't, especially since the burger is not juicy at all). There should be somewhere within online ordering to make a note, since they usually don't answer the phone.I didn't check ""cooked through"" which would imply the burger might be a little pink, but it wasn't, it was cooked through.The fried chicken sandwich was so disappointing I can't believe it. There was almost no chicken in it, and I was starving after I ate it. When one orders a fried chicken sandwich they expect a nice big juicy piece of chicken. This was a few tiny sliced pieces of chicken, then heavily breaded, not crispy at all, probably the equivalent of one chicken strip. Not even every bite of the sandwich had chicken in it.Chicken strips also have not enough meat, too much breading and are over fried. Please change out the fryer oil. This place is an easy place to pick up from but the food is going downhill and we probably will have to stop relying on it.",4.0,1
So I remember-- the blue cheese burger was verrry salty. I'm not sure if it was just the cheese or how the meat was seasoned so I will try a different one next time. Fries would have been good I think but it turns out the order was ready half an hour before it had said online so I was late picking it up. Breakfast burritos are good. What bugs me a little is that they (almost) never answer the phone in the morning. It's easier for me to call an order in sometimes while I'm driving than to go through the online ordering system. I have gone elsewhere several times because they didn't pick up the phone. I was not impressed with the famous muffin.,3.0,0
"A room full of Garrison Keillors enjoying lunch hour with each other. Good friends find this a well placed and relaxed meeting spot. My very nice  Bartholomew's Cobble sandwich (turkey with mayo ) with a lovely pickle  captured most of the flavors of Thanksgiving (but where was the cranberry?). Self serve water available, bus your own table, but tips welcome.  Plenty of parking and seating is well spaced.",2.0,0
"Start your diet here! After 15 minutes on line, you order at the counter (with tip suggested), wrangle a seat among the hipsters and voila! A slider size burger is delivered to your table by a sullen server 20 minutes later on a pewter platter that makes you wonder where's the rest of the meal? At $8 to $12 per burger you expect a bit more in this hippie town with the cannabis dispensary two doors away.  The fries were ordered with Parmesan but came with Pecorino. Ah, for the days of yore when this place was a Friendly's and a hamburger platter could feed a family!",5.0,1
"Got the zucchini feta quiche to go & though had asked it to be just warmed up, it was overheated & splotched all over the container, but the consistency of the filling & crust was superb.

Meaty large bacon on the side.  I paid with a $20 and left $2+change for tip.  Service included prepared food brought to table and plain coffee picked up at point of order.  I'd describe ambiance decor at country sheik, farmhouse, industrial but shy of rustic.  Considering four stars for absent coffee accoutrements like cinnamon, cocoa, at the sugar and creaming station with plenty of counter space though did have lids lending to portability.",4.5,1
"We love Western Mass for many reasons. That ""vibe"" is the main reason, that laid-back hippie-like/Bohemian atmosphere you find amongst the cannabis billboards in small town after small town in this part of the state.So, it's really no surprise that the Marketplace Kitchen has an awesomely named breakfast choice that goes by the name of Jerry Garcia, and it's no surprise to me that I leaped at the chance to check it out.The Jerry is one egg, chorizo, corn hash, pepper jack cheese, fresh salsa, & guacamole. Not a bad combo of ingredients, right? But what's groovy about the Marketplace is that you can order their breakfast dishes four ways.Want it as a sandwich? No worries, man, you can do your sandwich thing for $6.95.Want it as a burrito? You can take your Jerry on a burrito trip for $7.45.Want it in a breakfast bowl served over greens? Groovy, man you can do that for $7.95.And if you are starving with a serious case of the munchies, you can feast on an omelet with home fries for a pretty reasonable $8.95.My breakfast was excellent- lots of contrasting colors and textures, and most importantly- great taste. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1fgGvql5Rjsy6qfKGpLJpA&userid=cVrM2BvOvPV0Vi_rC8kepQWe had a nice cozy table next to a gas fireplace on the wall, perfect for relaxing and people watching.The meal was a terrific part of our meanderings in the People's Republic of Western Massachusetts.They're open seven days a week, so go ""Put your money where your love is"" and support this gem of a place.",2.0,0

"The few times I have gotten food from here, it has been okay at best. But tonight my roommate got me takeout from here for dinner - a ""table classic burger"" - and within an hour of me eating it I was feeling dizzy and nauseous. At which point I started violently throwing up. I hadn't eaten anything else out of the ordinary so it was definitely the burger that caused this. I don't even know what could be so wrong with a burger that it would illicit this reaction from the human body. I have had my fair share of unfortunate reactions to food, but this was like nothing I've ever experienced.",5.0,1
"Stopped in for breakfast before hiking nearby. Food/drinks are ordered at the counter and then brought out to you. Everyone's food looked so delicious. I got the Ol'Egger as a burrito which was yummy. If I went again I would definitely add a side of potatoes. There were some vegetarian options, as well as non-dairy milk for the coffee. They have outdoor seating, and the closer tables inside are separated by plastic at the moment in case you are worried about being too close to other guests.",4.0,1

Stopped here while traveling through MA after reading reviews online. The line was out the door when I arrived so obviously a local hot spot. You order at the counter and you get a number and your food is brought out to your table. Lots of gluten free options here. I ordered the grilled chicken avocado sandwich bread less over a salad. It was very tasty and plentiful with chicken. They asked if I had a gluten allergy and they indicated it on my order so the people preparing the food would take caution. The automatics were a bit loud. There was a group of high school students eating. Probably 15 of them so it was just poor timing for me. Cozy feeling with a small fireplace. Would definitely go back if passing through agai.,1.0,0

Our check for breakfast was $55 for 4 of us (2 had water, 2 had coffee, and not including tax or a tip). I was expecting a sit down service, real dishes and silverware and a real mug for coffee.  I am not a fan of paper plates and cardboard coffee cups when I am paying for breakfast at a restaurant that isn't fast food.  The place was c rowded.  Tables are close in proximity.  The floor was filthy.  The water pitcher was empty. They have plenty of staff behind the counter, but we only saw one poor woman running food and trying to keep up with the crowded restaurant area.  I had a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich.  The bread was delicious, but the scrambled eggs were cold.  My daughter liked her chocolate chip pancakes, my husband didn't care for the potatoes but liked his omelet.  My other daughter enjoyed her Jerry Garcia.  I would not rush back.",2.0,0
"I went here with a couple friends for dinner (even though I didn't want to) and my service dog in tow, despite my less than stellar previous experience. They didn't mind the dog and didn't give me a hard time about it, thankfully. First I was forced to buy a $5 bottle- sorry, box, of water because apparently I couldn't get a cup of free tap water. I proceeded to order a burger with fries and a small salad, and we went to go sit down. The waitress (if you can call her that since she just dropped the plates and left) brought our food out and I asked for some utensils and ketchup, and was told that I had to go get it myself. Normally I wouldn't make a fuss but she was standing right next to the table she was gesturing toward and refused to help me one bit despite having a large dog, two guests, and all of our luggage on the floor around us. We all had to climb over everything to grab simple amenities that should be provided already. Whatever, I guess. My burger was horrible. It was small, tasted weird and overcooked. I will say, my salad was delicious, so I enjoyed that at least, which is why I gave more than 1 star. After that, we had to bus our own table even after they pestered us all for a tip when ordering. I don't understand what I am supposed to be tipping for, when you did nothing for me.",3.0,0
"I was looking for a place to eat that I had not gone to in the past so I tried this place. The staff seemed very nice and helpful and the menu looked interesting. All I really came for was a hamburger so the rest of the items on the menu went generally unnoticed. The menu made the burger sound really good but in reality it was nothing more than a tiny little hockey puck. The burger was really small, overcooked, and very unappealing. You would think that being in a town with several other really good burger places that the owner would know what a good burger was. If the owner wants to try a great burger then go to Camp Fire down the street. A good burger comes from the butcher not the freezer. The fries were excellent. Expensive for Great Barrington, the prices would be fine in NYC if the burger was not lame.",4.5,1

"Undewhelming portions for more than they are worth. I was anticipating a nice breakfast plate of bacon and eggs fancifully named Meat Everest. After having to have the counter girl mumble through her face rag several times, I understood that I had a choice of sandwich, bowl and a couple of other servings. OK, I'll try the bowl as I could get an egg McMuffin if I wanted a sandwich. I got my coffee and went to the table to wait for my meal. It arrived in decent time. The 'bowl' is paper mache, like an egg carton, with a pile of stuff in it. Note: runny eggs tend to soak into the paper. The over easy eggs were almost over over easy. The bacon was fairly good. These were sitting on a pile of spinach leaves that had a tint of vinaigrette flavor, nice for a salad but not for breakfast. The staff is OK, the coffee is good but the prices are not reasonable for the amount.",5.0,1

"I knew exploring the Berkshires scenery would be risky from a food perspective, since many of the restaurants in the area close not long after sunset, and I lucked out arriving just before closing time.I got the double Hog Wild spicy pork burger. How many chances are there to try such a thing? It was a well-constructed sandwich with capable assists from cheddar and onions, but here's the thing: with a fennel vibe, it was essentially sausage. I don't mean that disrespectfully. My raves are reserved for the generous cup of hand-cut fries, so compelling that I burned through 30% of them before realizing that I forgot ketchup, and for the soup. Normally, split pea soup is like a pop-punk band that almost filled up arenas in 2003 but now plays Irving Plaza. And Marketplace has a brilliant work-around, giving this sturdy but old ingredient a more exciting co-headliner in the form of broccoli rabe.",4.0,1

"We stopped here a few weeks after they opened. It's a Friendly's with a hipster makeover. Very cute, great menu and busy! I like that it's *just* outside of downtown too.You can order any sandwich as a salad to make it gluten-free. I love this because I try to do this at other restaurants and end up with a leaf of iceberg lettuce and a burger patty. I had a curried chicken salad on a bed of mixed spring greens. Delicious!The only downside was that I sat near the counter where they call out the orders, which was a bit jarring for me.",2.0,0
"This place was pretty great food wise..... But their customer service is something else. Walking in a few minutes before 11 and told that breakfast is done at 11 and cut off before 11... Only reason it's not a1 star is because the food is fine, again, this review is for the service",5.0,1
Super yummy food.  Lots of veg options. Great atmosphere. Full (which is a good thing). The one down side is the easy-listening Music was painfully ... um ... painful. Maybe if they turned it down or changed it to fingernails on a chalk board or something less grating?  :),4.0,1

"Arrived Sunday at 1pm just before the brunch rush. The staff is not exactly friendly but the food was very good. I had the sunrise over quito which is listed as eggs, kale, quinoa, goat cheese, and edamame. I asked the cashier how the eggs were  prepared and she told me scrambled. I said great, I'll have that then she asked me if I wanted an omelette, scrambled,  or in a burrito....? I'm sorry, didn't you just say the eggs are scrambled full stop?  Anywho, I opted for the omelette and it was yummy. I would probably go back  when I'm in the area.",5.0,1
"Wonderful breakfast and wish I lived closer to try so many other things on their menu!Stopped by for breakfast after reading a few reviews that sounded like this place cared about ingredients. We were not disappointed! The staff we interacted with were all friendly and helpful. They have modified the place to deal with COVID - spaced out indoor dining, two outdoor areas, one-way walking, etc. We ordered at the counter, but our meals were then delivered to where we were sitting. The blueberry pancakes were as good as homemade (and came with pure maple syrup, which as a New Englander I feel is the ONLY way they should be served). The bacon was tasty and substantial. The Sunrise Over Quito omelet (magic sauce on the side) was so delicious - quinoa, kale, edamame, arugula, goat cheese. We were fueled for our day of exploring the area. If back in Stockbridge we will be sure to eat here again!!",1.0,0

"I´ve been to the Marketplace in Great Barrington for almost a year now. For me it´s the central place NUMBER ONE in the Berkshires. I´m always heading to the Marketplace during lunch break and having my cup of coffee over there. I really enjoy the atmosphere and the very open and courteous staff. They're always kind and pleasant.The food is amazing! My secret tip is the chocolate cake. I like the whole concept in general and i love to support that.So, if you're nearby, you should definitely check out this place, its worth it by far! Thumbs up and keep going! Great Business! Great Place!",4.0,1
"The wife and I had lunch at The Marketplace a few days ago.  The restaurant doesn't have much in the way of ambiance and you have to order your food when you come in (they bring it to your table when it's ready),  but the staff is friendly and the burgers and fries are very good.  We also had the beef and barley soup, which was good but just a bit heavy on the Worcestershire sauce, IMO.",5.0,1
"We stopped in today to pick up some lunch as we are vacationing in Lee for the weekend. This place did not disappoint!!!  Ordered 2 Naked Granny salads and a Maggie May wrap, that were just delicious. I LOVE salad, but I can also be snobby about it. I want fresh vegetables with a tasty dressing that isn't a million calories, and some tasty add-ins, and that's exactly what I got here. Everything was fresh, crisp and tasty. Only complaint I have was that the veggies that were used were more stalk than actual leaf. But seriously, this was just so tasty!!! Everything on their menu looked good, so I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order.",4.5,1
"I had a great experience here for lunch/dinner. The staff are very friendly, the food is fresh, and the atmosphere is relaxing.

I had the Stockbridge Bowl which is described as a salad with kale quinoa and edamame but there was no kale (just regular lettuce and arugula) and I found 2  edamame (exactly). In addition the pickled veggies were over powering and it tasted like strong vinegar. It sounded great but the delivery was so poor. I Am very disappointed.,5.0,1
"Highly impressed!  We were driving through town, gassed up, and stopped here to grab a bite.  It's high quality food, fast.  We ordered a delicious soup and a chicken avocado sandwich that was super tasty and served on substantial bread.

"My experience at Marketplace is always positive. The staff who work at Marketplace are some of the kindest individuals and authentically show that they truly care about the customer. They remember my name and exactly how I like things ordered. They are so kind and helpful and in general I have found that they will go out of their way to satisfy the customers needs. They are able to adapt items on their menu to meet the customers satisfaction such as changing around how a sandwich is made and trying to figure out the cheapest cost for the customer as well. The lattes happen to be some of my favorite in town! They use Barrington Roast, a local and quite lovely espresso bean! The place is often packed so you know folks in town love the place! There are ample places to sit inside and outdoors which is very helpful and there is always working wifi and plenty of outlets surround the walls so you can plug in your computer and do some work if you need to. The dining area and bathrooms are always looking clean and kept up well. The management seems very organized and on top of their agenda. They are also very kind and giving in their time and in wanting to make sure their customers feel a warm sense of being taken care of. There is definitely a sense of community when eating at Marketplace and the dining area is arranged in a way that is comfortable and not too squishy but also both large and smaller groups can be seated together. There are pillows on the benches lining the walls which adds a nice comforting touch! Overall I find the food to taste very good. I am not a fan of everything on the menu, however I always find something to meet my taste buds and enjoy the atmosphere, customer service and friendly vibe of the place. Sometimes when it is very busy (particularly on weekends or during the summer when increased tourism hits) there are longer wait lines, but it is definitely worth the wait!",4.5,1
"Going with three stars because we had a great waiter and one of our meals was comped. My wife and I went here with high intentions, especially from the pictures online and this app. However, I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and for 16$ plus 2.50$ for bacon - the burger unfortunately lacked any flavor. My wife ordered the Steak stout which looked absolutely delicious but the steak tasted soggy, looked whiteish and lacked any grill char or seasoning at all - almost like it was boiled. We ordered Buffalo chicken sliders as an app and they along with the homemade ranch were good - however the ranch we had with our salad was very runny. Wanted to give a better review but there needs to be more flavor put into the food - the steak needed a good sear on both sides and to be seasoned along with the grass fed burger. May try again if we are back in the area.",5.0,1
"Service is kind and warm. But they did take a while to get our food out (there were three of us, and we ordered two burgers and chicken fingers) -- about 25 mins. And this was at an off time (2:00 pm). The food. Sigh. The food was pretty bad. The burger was dry. The fries were ok. The chicken tenders were ok. The cup of cheddar ale soup was broken...or curdled and it wasn't seasoned. The bill was as 72.60. That's just too much for mediocre burgers, a cup of curdled cheddar soup, and chicken tenders. Everyone was so nice. I wish the food was better. Two stars because they were nice.",3.0,0
Our group of 12 stopped here for lunch / beer on a bachelorette. We made a reservation ahead of time and were able to sit at 2 big tables in a room almost all by ourselves (probably better for everyone involved). Beer flights were available and plenty of options on the menu. The fries and Mac and cheese were big hits. We also could not stop looking at the HUGE chocolate cake and pies on display. So we got some to go. Everyone was so nice and it felt very homey - highly recommend (even for big groups!),2.0,0
Was staying in town for a couple days pre ordered Easter prime rib $28 asked for rare . Was extremely dissatisfying!!!!! It was well done cardboard. Was told when I called to complain sorry they're all like that . You should have stopped selling it . Or did you over sell and think a 1/4 inch slice of prime rib cooked to death . Would do ! So not impressed ! Yesterday I went in and ordered 3 hamburgers they were hockey pucks . No apology. Nothing !!! I'll never eat there again . You use to be one of the best places to eat . You just lost 3 customers. But 2 bad meals in 2 days !!! You need to look at your restaurant consider closing . Your expert is beer ok make it a bar! Your food was awful!!!!,5.0,1

I ordered the Spinach Salad with grilled chicken, it was absolutely delicious, excellent dressing, chicken was tender and goat cheese!

I understand if children are making noise and kicking the seats every now and then (they were otherwise quiet and not running around and coloring) but to not have any grace when you come over to the table to alert the table that others in the restaurant are displeased was disheartening. The Server was lucky that it was a larger party and she received a tip automatically. This is NOT a family friendly place. Upon trying to to tell the staff on the way out, they were unbelievably shocked and chagrined at how they had treated us after obviously talking about us the entire meal. Very displeased.",4.0,1

"I don't drink beer. Never have. Never will. But when some lunch spots were closed early for the day on a frigid late Saturday afternoon, Barrington Brewery came up open with good eats. Located in a gravel lot on Stockbridge Rd in Great Barrington, BB has brews my husband could pick from and blessed with nice food, some wine, cocktails and canned drinks too- in a vibey space. My husband likes a good beer and settled on the English-style, Barrington Brown- Brown Ale which he paired it with a cup of (meat) Chili [there's also a Vegan option]. He liked the meatiness in his Buffalo wings- but felt they needed that crunch. Pretzel sticks were pillowy and so good. I enjoyed my Beer-Battered Cod Sandwich on a Brioche bun and had that classic lightness with a Rosé. Our server was on top of everything and price was awesome for lunch.

The food was very mediocre. The Mac and cheese was dry noodles... practically sauceless. Old school hand written bill. Waitress wrote down sandwich $3 more than the menu price.

"The beer is excellent. The ambience about what you'd expect. Why two stars only?  two things:there is a ""quant"" old fashioned cash register behind the bar. While ai was sitting at the bar trying to enjoy my meal and my experience the nice person working behind the bar had to use the register to get several paid customer checks into ""the system"". Each time she had occasion to do this there would be something like five minutes of her pushing buttons on the old thing and then having all the gears inside move around registering the transaction and ringing the bell. over and over and over and over and over again. Get a f***ing modern cash management system and equipment in there. It's almost 2023!!!!  So much unnecessary and annoying NOISE. For what!!!!!?????I ordered the bratwurst. It was laughably puny. it was like a double length breakfast sausage. so so so so disappointing.  talk to the guys who grill the brats at the Farmer's Market on Saturdays.  Seriously.  Like I said, I enjoyed my beer.",1.0,0

"Rude or untrained staff and Over priced for the quality of the food. We arrived a little after 4pm, which we waited awhile to be steated (it was dead). The bartender made eye contact MANY times but gave no direction or sat us (like the sign said). My husband eventually walked and found someone after waiting over 5+ mins. We ordered drinks, apps and dinner. I didn't get a brewery vibe but I thought at least they have food... The drinks were okay, the mozzarella sticks definitely weren't good, but the chicken tenders were better than expected! The eggplant dinner dish was basically chunky tomato sauce with gross eggplant, that was a disappointment, the brisket sandwich was mediocre, the corn beef Ruben was okay. Definitely think they need to choose food or drinks so one can be hopefully amazing.If you are in a tight pinch and don't want to drive while staying around Lee it's a great spot to feed the family and have a drink, but if you aren't in a tight spot I recommend driving to find better.

"Just another review to comment on the poor staffing. Maybe if there are enough management will take the hint???  I had to go in search of my waiter when part of my meal didn't arrive and I was mostly done with what had arrived (that is, it had been quite some time and he never checked in). He was chatting with four other waiters inside (not actually busy). He never asked how our meals were. We finished eating and waited for the check. And waited. Next we saw him picking up ketchup from all the tables. He studiously avoided any eye contact with us and disappeared again. Finally had to go in search of the check. I'm sure he's left wondering why the tip was so low. That said, food was very good. They just need to improve the staffing.",2.0,0
"Terrible food, terrible service.I went here tonight as they offer food on top of their house made beers.  I don't drink, so I was there for the food.  What a mistake!  I got sat in full sun on a 90+ degree day.  The table of old follies next to me need another word to use that didn't start with the letter F.  They also burped loudly as if they were the only trash in the place.  Classy.I started with a water (no bottled here) with lemon.  The lemon slice I received was old, and literally had no meat, just an old peel. I ordered the wings, a simple dish that so many find a way to mess up.  The sauce was butter, with more butter added, and some red coloring.  Terrible.  It took 40 minutes to get them.Then I ordered the ribs, after being informed by my not so present waitress that ""most people don't complain"" about them.  Solid sale mind you.  I had a full rack.  No fork supplied.  The meat was terrible; dry, fatty, just terrible.  The sauce wasn't even a BBQ sauce and it was just squirted on top.  I would score them inedible for a dog.Then the check.  $60.  What???  For what??Just nasty.  Hopefully their beer is better, but I'll never be back regardless.  Just terrible.  Never again.",1.0,0
"I literally had the best burger of my life... omg it was so juicy and delicious yummmmmmmmmm. I ordered a medium rare brew burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, American cheese, and bacon. My mouth was watering as the waiter walked around the corner, I saw him approach and I hoped with all my heart that the burger mounted on those crispy chips was mine... and it was. I devoured that thing up like I hadn't eaten in years and left no scraps. Usually the medium rare burgers I order at other restaurants are dry, but when I took my first bite, I saw the perfectly pink color inside of the beef. Additionally, the cheese was perfectly melted and the corners of the slice dripped over the bun. Literally delicious. Delicioso. -Tessie",5.0,1
I was reluctant to leave a slightly bad review but I thought about it a lot and I'm going to do it anywayThe food we had was just plain bad the fish sandwich was awful it was uncooked to  it fell apart when I picked it up and it was mostly just greasy dough and very little fish. they charge about$14 and don't include french fries anymore you have to pay extra for French fries with a $14 fish sandwich. (So closer to $20 for an uncooked fish sandwich)It was also cold and not cooked. What little bit of fish in the sandwich I'm pretty sure was pollock a cheaper version of fish than the cod they advertise.,2.0,0

"Decent beer, but bad service. Lots of potential at this place, but something was very off. We waited over an hour after our first round before the waitress ever came back to us. I hate writing poor reviews but this was warranted. We ordered two beers and unfortunately, after the first sip we realized we were given their porter, instead of the stout. Although the porter was good, we were disappointed not to get the creamy stout that we ordered. Our waitress never returned thereafter, so we didn't even have an opportunity to tell her (the porter was listed as cask conditioned and more $). Many of the guests seated in our area were also waiting for service and couldn't get anyone to wait on them. No excuses for this, as multiple people came into the restaurant to dine after most people in our section, and they were given drink and food orders almost immediately. We counted over four new tables were seated before anyone on staff acknowledged our whole section. One table had ordered/ate their food and couldn't get their check - they sat there for over 25 minutes and were still waiting as we were leaving. It became clear that most of the bartenders and waitresses didn't have a system in place for adequate service. On multiple occasions, too, patrons with growers and brewery mugs came in and were given immediate service and monopolized any/all attention of the staff. Very unprofessional and sadly we won't be back. There are too many great restaurants and breweries in the area to spend any future time/money here. I know every place has bad days and would've expected some acknowledgement of their mess up (totally understandable) but it was clear they didn't care.",1.0,0
"We stopped by this spot for lunch after a long hike and enjoyed our experience. It looked like they had a nice outdoor patio in the back covered with a tent but it was full when we went so we sat inside. My fiancé ordered the pilsner and felt it was crisp and refreshing. We ordered the boneless buffalo chicken wings to start and they came out perfectly cooked, they were both tender and crispy. For lunch, I ordered the Tuscan eggplant sandwich which I felt was a bit soggy but the eggplant was cooked well. My fiancé ordered the turkey rueben which he felt had a nice sauerkraut that wasn't overpowering and was served on crispy bread. Overall we enjoyed it and if I were to go back I would definitely try some of their desserts that looked pretty tasty but we were too full to try.",4.0,1

Very disappointed in our lunch. Food was ok but not great. Hostess was rude and acted like we were a bother for her to seat us. Our waitress was nice but slow as a slug but compared to some of the others staff at least she was nice. They brought a bowl of water for our dog which was nice. The real issue was the way people acted. There was a table of about 8 people dropping the f bomb and burping rudely. Then there was the blind couple with the annoying dogs. Instead of asking them to leave the waitstaff ignored them. And when they came up to complain they asked them to leave in front of everyone in the outdoor seating. Then the table next to us had a loud young woman who was just an awful person. And the other table had a couple on a FaceTime call. Find somewhere else to go. This place does not have the Berkshire vibe at all!,2.0,0
"I agree with Mike Z's post of four days ago. My friend and I drove from West Springfield, MA yesterday expecting to have a nice lunch in the Berkshires. On the contrary, instead we were greeted by a very unfriendly man mandating we show proof of our vaccination status at the door. We explained that we were both fully vaccinated which meant nothing to him or his establishment. I have been going to this restaurant for years but will never give them the opportunity again. They lost at least $100.00 in business and a customer for life. Woke restaurant of the highest order!!!",1.0,0

"We recently had dinner at the Barrington Brewery in Great Barrington, MA.We had made dinner reservations, and their system seemed to work well. We were seated outside where the tables were separated just enough due to Covid, but it still felt like a nice spot.The food and beer were great. The cheddar ale soup was a nice start, and the brisket was cooked well. The mac and cheese and cornbread that went with were also good. And like many other reviewers mentioned, the chocolate stout cake was great. We got an order to go, and had enough cake for a few days.The service, however, left a lot to be desired. Our server was very cold and short with us, and we saw her only a few times throughout the night. We were never told about any specials, though we overheard about them from the table next to us. We were given the bill without being asked about dessert, and then had to have the bill adjusted. A good meal with some issues with service. All in all an OK experience.",1.0,0
"Super disappointed.  Food was served cold and tasteless.  Water served in plastic disposable cups.  The ribs were fatty and inedible.  The crabcake was cold and dry.

"Oxacana is their hottest wing flavor. And  it goes beyond the three stars listed on the menu. It is hot! And if you like spicy you are in for a treat. It's a seriously unique flavor that comes on some truly jumbo wings!I ended up ordering a side of the sweet corn bread to go with this flamey amazing sauce. It was the perfect cool down.This sauce also caused me to down two of their amazing Blonde ales in record time. Those were outstanding as well.I really wanted to try to beer cake, which looked superb and others on here have raved about.",1.0,0

"Wait staff was a bit all over. Mixed up entrees, drinks.... as in gave my 11 year old my husband beer.   No biggie, but then brought my daughter a beef burger instead of the veggie burger we ordered.  She'd disappeared after bringing food, so after a while, hubby had to go find her and let her know.   Frazzled, She blamed the kitchen.  Food was meh.  Just underwhelmed. Nothing crazy bad but we don't eat out often these days, and this was disappointing.",3.0,0
"My parents were visiting and we decided to try it out. So glad we did! Our prompt server was absolutely lovely and attentive. She took our drink orders immediately and gave us the specials. We ordered the Mushroom Barley soup, Beef Chili, and a wrap called the Brewer's Pocket (spinach, smoked turkey, bacon, red onion, blue cheese dressing, baked in a pita pocket with melted Swiss cheese - yum!), and the beer-battered fries.The food was delicious - soups were hearty and flavorful, the sandwich was hot and freshly made, and the fries were fresh and very crispy. We had no intention of having dessert, but our server informed us there were freshly baked fruit pies made by the Sweetest Chef (nearby) and we had to have a couple of slices of cherry and mixed berry pies. They arrived with fresh whipped cream on top. Spectacular. The atmosphere is very much a tavern. If you're expecting polished and fancy, this is not the place for you. The bar is lively, the music is laid back (nice - today was a mix of 70s JT, Fleetwood Mac, Jackson Browne, etc.), and we never felt rushed. They prefer cash to avoid fees, but will accept credit cards. Then there's the BREWERY part... I'll have to go back to try their sustainable solar-powered brewery products. I'm a huge fan and will return again!They will require proof of vaccination for all diners beginning 10/20/21, which made me love them even more!",5.0,1

"We come to this Restaurant once a year.  Standard pub fare and they have a good selection of their own brewed beer.  I ordered the Bear Stout.  I didn't really enjoy it as I normally drink Guiness or Left Hand Milk Stout.  I did really like the raspberry ale.  It was light fruity and very easy to drink.  I would recommend it highly.  We ordered the sausage sampler.  Which was okay.  Some funky ones and some really good ones.  Which will average out to be okay.  I couldn't remember if I ordered the sampler before but when I tasted the funky one I realized that I did order it before.  I probably will order it again next year and go through the same thought process.    Wife and I ordered the BBQ burger.  It is good.  Lots of beef well cooked and the fries are really good.  We didn't order dessert as we were too full but everyone seemed to be ordering the chocolate cake.  They give you a HUGE slice.  Kids menu was good with abundant selection.  Kids got a juice, entree and dessert for $8.  See you next year Barrington Brewery!",4.0,1
Always great food and service.  The atmosphere definitely allows you to enjoy the many types of beer that's made on-site.  Brisket is amazing and the raspberry lager is a great compliment for any meal.  Highly recommended!,4.0,1

"My husband and I have always loved going to the barrington brewery. We normally have a great meal, great beer and great service. Unfortunately this past weekend a large group of family decided to go to the brewery after an event in Stockbridge. The hostess and several of the wait staff were extremely rude and seemed to not want the business. We went in between lunch and dinner. The restaurant and outside tent area were practically empty. But we were repeatedly told they were to busy for us and that we could sit at some picnic tables and get beers and food at their outdoor window on the other side of the building. We weren't allowed to sit at the tables with umbrellas or under the tent. They kept saying that it was for table service only. We had some people only having drinks mixed with half our group wanting to eat as well. Very disappointed with the rude staff, because we have always enjoyed it there.

The table mats explained the brewing process for the beer and the menus offered a fresh selection of brews on tap. I was not expecting much by way of the food, but my barbecue burger (with, it seemed like, double cheddar cheese and caramelized onions) was really, really tasty! I ate up absolutely everything on my plate!  I only wish that I had had more room left to eat the towering multi-layered chocolate cake or try the pie for dessert! Maybe next time. :)",4.0,1
"We were not super impressed when we stopped here in September for dinner. Their COVID precautions were great- we even had a QR code to scan to see the menu so that we weren't touching menus that others had touched. But the food left a lot to be desired. Right before we ordered, we heard one of the staff saying that the grill wasn't working. We confirmed with our waiter that we could not order burgers because of the grill, which was frustrating because we had chosen this spot for the burgers. I instead ordered fish and chips. The batter was good but the fish was way overcooked to the point where it was chewy and unappetizing. The beer was fine, but nothing special. I might come back to try a burger, but otherwise I'd pass if driving through here again.",2.0,0

"If I could do ZERO STARS  I would My wife has been wanting me to experience the food and service here... sadly, I got neither. We got here at 12:30 and were seated almost immediately, good sign.The server came, never introduced herself, took our drink order and walked away. In this time, another group came and was seated near us.We waited 15 minutes for a Raspberry Ale and an Arnold Palmer, which were dripping wet from the sides of the glasses when she brought them to us and walked away without ever saying a single word.At the same time, the server at the table next to us took the group's (of 4) drink and food order and we were never given the opportunity to place our order by our server. Another 15 minutes passed and still we were waiting while others got their food and/or drinks and it was obvious that we were being overlooked and after waiting SO LONG, it really started to feel intentional and I hate the thought of the color of my skin being a factor as their was only one other person who shared my skin color in the restaurant except he had the advantage of being with a much larger party of people of 'a different race', whereas it was just my wife and me.Finally after more than a  1/2 hour, we got up to leave, not having touched our drinks but being thoroughly full of 'IT' (lack of professionalism, lack of attentiveness, lack of service... oh, and lack of food.After my wife spoke to the owner, she came back to me upset and stated to me that she told him that I do reviews for Yelp! and his response was, ""I hate Yelp!"" I went in to talk to him, I didn't raise my voice, nor was I disrespectful to him. He was very rude, extremely belligerent and refused to hear anything I had to say which was, ""No, the customer IS NOT always right but customers are the reason that good businesses stay in business."" He had some back and forth words with my wife as I tried to diffuse the situation and he ultimately told us to ""Take a hike!""Follow up... as expected the owner of this business, Gary Happ responded with the same unprofessionalism in which he responds to anyone who have negative experiences at his establishment. Still he fails to see that his barbaric, bullying belligerence have NO place in today's society. He accused ME of threatening to write a Yelp! review, which I never did. My wife said that to him. I never tell a person that I write reviews for Yelp! I just do it and I leave them to respond after reading in. Then too, I never said that my skin color or my wife's sex played a factor, what I said was, ""I hate to think that my race and my wife's sex played a factor."" Again the owner of this business continues to act like a man 'out of time'... like the dinosaurs that failed to adapt and went extinct, his unwillingness to accept blame without blaming rises to the top like sediment (pond scum) on a pond. If you're going to apologize and expect to be taken sincerely, don't accuse and point a finger because it renders your apology hollow, null and void. What was done favorably in the past means nothing when your present actions belie and contradict your positive efforts... Based on Gary H's response, I do now feel that my skin color was a factor. The difference between me and the other patrons who you've responded to with that condescending tone, belligerence and bullying is that I KNOW that the Pen definitely is MIGHTIER than the sword. You NEED to change your business ethics like I said, you WILL change and treat everyone regardless of skin color, sex, ethnic group or sexual orientation with the same decency and respect that you would want for you and your loved ones.  Fix it NOW, please... otherwise, like blood hemorrhaging from a gaping would, the ink from my pen will flow unchecked until you see what I tried calmly to express to you yesterday to no avail. The next move is yours and I pray that it's the only one that can salvage relationships and what you clearly hold dear because I too was watching you yesterday when we sat waiting and waiting, you too walked by, no greeting, no introduction, no dialogue... wiping the chairs was more important than gauging the temperature of your patrons' experience. Or perhaps you only speak to the ones who don't look like me.require a written response from the business. We value letters of experience submitted by consumers.

"Hi Nate - We have read your (many) reviews of your experience yesterday (including the one to the BBB that was thrown out). Clearly, we missed the mark when it comes to our service at our establishment and for that we apologize. New staff, old staff, being short staffed, incredible volume...a variety of factors may have played into the reason for a delay in your server getting back to your table. But, we are not here to discuss that. One thing that did NOT play a factor was the color of your skin, and we are alarmed to read these accusations. The owner you spoke to has been in business in our community for 44 years. His businesses have always been inclusive, welcoming, charitable and well received. In fact, two years ago, he and his business partner were named business persons of the year.  Accusing a business/staff/owner of anything related to the ""color of your skin"" in a situation such as yours, where we clearly just were a step behind, understaffed, does not fit the bil. Furthermore, anyone threatening to ""Write a review on yelp"" is never a way to get anyone to listen to your concern. This business [yelp], and those who use it to ""write reviews"" is quite aptly named: Yelp, [definition] - ""a short, sharp cry, especially of pain or alarm"". People love to hate us on yelp. Please give those around you some grace, thank the people who are quite literally busting their asses to serve you, be patient, be kind and please take your negativity elsewhere.

"Visiting the area and had to order from one of my favorite spots. I ordered tuna melt, avocado melt with tuna (my favorite!) and a corned beef reuben for take out. They have a great covid set up. I walked up to a window with a menu and ordering/ pick up window. On the menu posted at the window tuna melt was $8 but I was charged $10 tuna and $13 avocado tuna melt, $13.50 for the reuben. The sandwiches were good but very small; smaller than what I have been served there and it wasn't cut in half. None of the sandwiches came with pickles/ fries/ chips/ coleslaw. Nothing. We were just served a sandwich. I don't understand the price discrepancy posted at the window and what we were charged. I also don't justify the price without any pickles or sides. Really disappointed with the service. Despite this we decided to order from here one more time for take out. This time we ordered Cobb salads, Caesar salad and burgers. The burger came as a burger and bun. There was no lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle. The Caesar salad didn't have cheese. The Cobb salads didn't come with any dressings. Utterly disappointed. We are trying to support local businesses and have enjoyed eating here in the past but this is NOT up to standards and the price tag we paid. By this point I would expect they have perfected their to-go service but this is not up to par. Will not be dining here any time soon.",5.0,1
"I've been here a few times and I haven't had a bad meal yet; granted I've never had any meat dishes. I had the tuna melt and really liked it.

So on 2 occasions I have ordered the avocado melt with tuna fish, it comes on wheat toast with a pickle and coleslaw. It's delicious! The avocado is perfect and the bread is always toasted just right. The tuna melt and the avocado melt are both $12 which is a good price. When I have ordered the avocado tuna melt it was $16 which I thought was a little bit pricey. I love looking at all the fresh baked goods when you walk in and are waiting to be seated.

"On the eve of Fat Tuesday, what better occasion to pen a review on my favorite Cajun chicken sandwich, found on the menu at Barrington Brewery.Sure, I had an all-around great experience here for dinner on a Saturday night: the beer was flowing like wine (I had the Berkshire Blonde and it went down too easy!), and the service was friendly and remarkably fast; however, it's the Cajun chicken sandwich that cinches this 5-star review.I still dream about this sandwich. It's not that there was anything particularly extra about this one; in fact, I think the ""less is more"" philosophy is really what makes this so special. The menu description is pretty basic: ""Chicken breast, pan seared with Cajun spices, served on a roll with lettuce, tomato, and mayo,"" yet this guy was calling my name, so I just knew there had to be something special about this sandwich. In hindsight, it was the best decision I made that weekend (and that was a pretty good weekend!).I'm no top chef, but I know there's a difference between, ""Cajun seasoning,"" vs. ""blackened seasoning,"" and it seems many kitchens interchange the two, but don't exactly deliver. Not the case at Barrington Brewery; they nailed the prep and the flavor, as I really enjoyed the authentic Cajun seasoning (yes to paprika!), and the chicken breast was pan seared just right, giving it a crunchy crust and lots of flavor!For a busy Saturday night around peak hours - just after the early-bird special crowd, but right before the date/family night rush (6:30 pm), we had a minimal wait, which provided just enough time to head to the bar, grab a beer, and do some Instagramming before being seated. I was really surprised at how fast the food came out - piping hot, and really delicious.The place was poppin, and I really liked the fast-paced, yet laid back vibe - it reminded me a little bit of Brown's Brewing in Troy, NY - where the restaurant is just as busy/popular as the brewery and its beer!So next time you may be passing through this part of Western Massachusetts, a stone's throw from the Capital Region and nestled in the highlands of Massachusetts in the beautiful Berkshires (severely underrated and overshadowed by the equally cool Catskills, btw!) you should absolutely give this brewery a try.And if you really want to Roux the day, order that Cajun chicken sandwich! You just might be speaking Creole when you're through!",4.0,1
"5 of us stopped here to grab lunch after traveling from NY on a trip. Server was extremely rude. She never asked if we were on same ticket, automatically presumed & when we asked for it to be separated, she refused to ""write separate tickets"", told us to ""figure it out ourselves"" which was difficult considering we planned to use bank cards but scrambled enough cash & only enough cash left to leave $10.  Placing the entire tab on one person's bank card was not an option for our group of 5. She literally counted the tip in front of my mom & I and replied, ""$10, you're only leaving $10"". I was so shocked as we have never been treated so poorly at a restaurant. I hope no one has the same experience if you choose to eat there but definitely do not recommend.

"Hi Dave - Thanks for your feedback. We have been brewing the same style of beer here in our barns since 1995. Our style is predominately ""English"" and differs from the new brewers that have popped up over the last decade. Our goal has always been to have well balanced, drinkable ales that aren't extreme in any direction. Hope to see you again soon.",3.0,0
Way to expensive for the food that you get. My buddy's steak was bland and he wasn't impressed with the cost  My salmon BLT was good but it was pricey. The beers were okay but not outstanding. My daughter did like the mashed potatoes and I thought so also.  My wife's chicken sandwich was okay but very sloppy.,3.0,0
"Come for the beer, stay for the beer. We were in town visiting friends and they recommended it for great beer with dinner.I ordered the Ice Glen IPA, a very good pick. Boyfriend got the sampler: Black and Tan (subbed for the Blonde Ale), Pale Ale, Brown Ale, Stout, and IPA. Out of all, my fave was still the IPA. Friends really liked the Brown Ale.Food was hometown fare: burgers, shepherds pie, pot pie, ribs, etc. I ordered a burger which served its purpose of soaking up some of the alcohol. Service was spot on and pleasant.",1.0,0

"Don't go to this place based on Chrissy's horrible skills as a waitress.Waiter had such an attitude and got my order wrong. If she has that attitude, then why even work here? Rushed and didn't even bother to check up on us. It wasn't even busy today, 08/24/19. Will not be returning, due to her. Sort of good food.She had the audacity to come to our table after we wrote a review on the back of the check. She said all false accusations, she never checked on us, took plates, or even asked if we liked the food. Such a horrible waitress, why even confront us about the review? If you're defensive, then it's true.",5.0,1

The setup for traffic flow, social distancing and sanitizing were all top-notch and executed well by friendly staff. Additionally, the food was GREAT. Ok, it's pub food, but GOOD pub food! We had wings; the best onion rings I've ever eaten; smoked salmon salad; and a spinach salad with chicken.

"Zipping through Western Mass, and the craving for a full out trough of nachos hits us like a ton of chips and cheese and jalapeños and other things.Thanks Yelp app, for showing us the way.Barrington Brewery is about 15 minutes off the beaten path, but well worth the stop if you're packing kids (family friendly), beer aficionados (it's a brewery, duh), or kooky hippies who want the sun to fuel their every action (the beer is solar brewed, huzzah!).We came for 'chos. And 'cho they knows.A veritable mountain of store-bought chips bombarded with layers of molten cheese, more sour cream than you need to re-flora a nation of imbalanced GI tracts, and (on request) vegetarian chili to protein out the strong cheddar jack showing. I was expecting a meal, and even I - strong of appetite and long on the road - could not tame the beast. Calorie for calorie, it's a steal for $8 (extra for the chili, but worth it).Her ad hoc grilled cheese wasn't, more of a cool Kraft Singles sandwich, and our beers hit the satisfying middle - we weren't wowed, but they're fresh as next door and worth the $5 per pint. Grab a flight for the same price and get tipsy while your DD sips a soda (unlimited refills?)Pool table upstairs, and a comfortable bar area with TVs covering the Whomevers playing the Doze Guys. Roll in with your crew, quaff a brew and settle in for a session of Bros Over 'Chos™",4.0,1

"Our family have enjoyed Barrington Brewery and Restaurant for a long time!  We have visited the place when our children were small and now as adults.  We have many great memories of special occasions such as Valentine's Day and Mother's Day or just casual visits with family and friends.  Whether you sit in their dining room, by the bar or outdoors in the summer, the service and food has always been reliable and consistent.  The food choices are satisfying and their menu caters to all; (yes they have vegetarian and vegan choices).  Their beers have delighted the adults whether they are seasonal varieties or signatures; there is a waiting list to obtain the house mugs even though they increase the number available each year!!!  The restaurant sits just outside of downtown Great Barrington on the way to another favorite town in Massachusetts, Stockbridge.  The décor is rustic, with dark woods and several fireplaces that contribute to the warm atmosphere during the winter months.  The brews holding tanks can be observed from the bar area or by the second floor landing where the game room is found, (great fun or spot to spend with children if you need to wait for table).  We have tried many dishes here that we like, however our family favorites are:  As appetizers, Nachos served with Chili, Crab cakes and local Sausage Sampler. For casual meal, the Chicken Pot Pie is excellent but meant for a hearty appetite!!  It is huge!!!  All their specialty burgers and super sandwiches are great! Their after 5pm menu is both satisfying and very affordable!  Always leave room for dessert; the Chocolate Stout Cake is out of this world! And the seasonal fruit crisps over ice cream another delight!!!  We tend to prefer dark beers, and their Barrington Brown Ale and Black Bear Stout fit the bill!! Barrington Brewery and Restaurant is and will always be our choice for great food and beer, excellent service and awesome times!!!",5.0,1
Food was delicious. We had the sausage sampler to start and really enjoyed it. We both had burgers that were delicious and cooked perfectly. The fries were amazing!!! Nice and crunchy and tasty. Onion rings also good. The best was the chocolate cake! Omg whatever you do.... get the chocolate cake even if you are full get a piece to take home! It's huge so you can definitely share it! Service was good. Decor was nice.,3.0,0
"Good beer and cider and very friendly bar tenders. Mediocre food. Meh. Run down dining room. They now require proof of Covid vaccine to enter which is silly.

"I went to have a lunch with my husband around 4pm or maybe I would call earlier dinner. The service is ok. The food took so long to get to my table maybe because I didn't order appetizers so too way to long... when the food arrived it wasn't so fresh. The Mac and cheese was dry and cold, the BBQ beef brisket was a little sour for me. Seating outside in the garden wasn't a great idea so so much insects. Need to eat fast and leave the bugs was so annoying",5.0,1

"The well-prepared pub-style food and other fare served at the restaurant serve as great accompaniment to the beer. Because that was what I really wanted to sample here. I arrived early for lunch, and as a result I got to spend a few minutes with Porter, their beautiful black cat, before I was seated for my meal. The regular menu features a nice assortment of burgers, sandwiches, apps, and sausages, and you can get the burgers either ""regular"" or grass-fed for slightly more. The beer made the meal for me. For about the same price, you can get either one pint of one of their brews, or a flight of five 3oz. beers. I was quite fond of their black bear stout. In nice weather, consider sitting outside, where you might get an inkling of Berkshire views in the distance.",5.0,1

"I was in the area checking out schools with my teenage son, desperate to feed him after a long day. This gem was directly across from our hotel. Really great beer selection, although I didn't partake. I'm guessing from the crowd at the bar enjoying the beer, I'd have enjoyed an IPA or two.  Quite a few people grabbing Growlers to take home.The food selection was great. Plentiful American menu. Soups, chili, ""pub food"" such as mozzarella sticks, wings and potato skins, plenty of seafood, ribs, steaks, burgers.....no problem finding something to feed my finicky kid.The service was fantastic. Our waitress was warm & friendly. Nice atmosphere and I felt as if I were surrounded by lots of locals who frequented the place. We we served quickly, attended to appropriately, and our dinners (ribs and chicken wings for him; broiled scallops for me) were delicious. They have delicious homemade salad dressings, too, a chocolate stout cake they make as well, which we grabbed to go. One slice is PLENTY for two people.If you're ever in the area, I highly recommend a visit.",3.0,0
Great place to go in the Great Barrington area. Kinda of stumbled upon it and was not disappointed. The craft beers were good and had a decent variety. The word is to get the Reuben or the burgers.

I often go to Great Barrington for work or for hikes. This is a beautiful small rich town on the border of New York and Massachusetts. I have been to this place multiple times. They have great beers. They have good options for vegetarian food. Its a small home brewery and the food is good. I make sure to visit this place whenever I am in Great Barrington. Just on little expensive side. Make sure you tell them to reduce the quantity of cheese if you are not a cheese person.,5.0,1
"Clean your freakin' beer lines!!  I guess my last review didn't make a big enough impression.  I was back at the Brewery this past weekend and was very much looking forward to drinking at least a couple of the interesting varieties you had to offer.  Wary from my last experience, I hoped that the pint I ordered would not be 'skunked'.  Sadly it was. Bad. Like, I could smell it before I tasted it. I tried my brother's choice and while it wasn't completely free of an off taste, it was better than the beer that I chose. So I ordered that and begrudgingly had a beer with dinner.You guys are a BREWERY that serves beer that you want people to find DELICIOUS so that they ORDER MORE.  I don't know how you stay in business serving perfectly good beer through disgusting, dirty lines!  And why don't more people call you on it!?  Do your regulars just think that this is how beer is supposed to taste? It's shameful.  Clean your damn lines every two weeks, and if you already are, fire the con artist who is cleaning them now and find someone who knows how to do it properly! At this point I doubt I'll ever be back, but for the sake of anyone who wanders through your doors or reads this post, get this figured out and stop putting people's health at risk.  It's a simple fix.",4.0,1

This past Saturday evening I had to return an ESB which I was looking forward to enjoying, and then the Pale Ale I substituted was better, but not entirely free of that off taste.  If you are going to serve, and be recognized for, great beers, why would you risk your reputation on lines that need cleaning? Perhaps we caught you towards the end of a cycle (should be every two weeks or so)?   We'll be back of course, because the quality here is usually on point, but I had to speak up so we can enjoy better beer next time! Thanks to the staff for an otherwise enjoyable experience.",3.0,0
"Came here with friends while visiting the area for a ski trip. The interior of this restaurant is cool and trendy. They have plenty of seating for small groups after 8PM for a late drink and are accommodating for larger groups if they have the seats.Upstairs there is a old school jukebox loaded with classics and is only $1 for 3 songs. The jukebox was the life of the party. There are two pool tables and plenty of seats for the every one upstairs. For a Saturday night though, this place was dead. I expected more people to be hanging out at this brew-pub.As for the beer - it's just okay. The pale ale's aromas were like dish soap but I wasn't sure if that was the glass that didn't get completely rinsed out. Friends in the group enjoyed the raspberry ale.Make sure to come through this place while visiting the area!",3.0,0

"Had a late lunch today on the way to Albany. We had a Veggie Burger ($7), a Chicken Philly Cheese Steak ($9), and a Brewers Pocket (spinach/turkey/bacon on pita for $9). All sandwiches came with a pickle and side of the day, which today was a nice but small 1/4 cup portion of cole slaw. Chips would have been nice. The sandwiches were all good. I had the veggie burger and it was real good, topped with optional sauteed peppers and onions for $0.50.We had some of the beers of course-  a Black Velvet (stout and champagne) and a very tasty Raspberry Lite. We wanted to take home a few bottles of the Raspberry, but it turned out it isn't for sale by the bottle -just by the growler. Same story as last time.. I didnt want a growler, I wanted one of the bottles but that wasnt an option. Oh well, I guess they have their reasons.....All three of us shared a slice (really a humongous slab) of their famous chocolate Stout Cake ($6.50) -it's been written up in one of the foodie mags . I'm here to swear that the three of us couldn't finish it. It was good in the way that all chocloate cake is good, but not OMG fabulous good-to-die-for.",5.0,1

Combine these two, and you have a terrific day trip.  BB&R was terrific- we had a Berkshire Blonde, and a Barrington Brown Ale. Berkshire Blonde is their light beer, but it had a somewhat stronger taste than I was anticipating.  The Brown Ale was terrific- smooth, creamy and awesome flavor. For lunch we had a smoked salmon BLT (very good, accompanied by sweet potato fries), and a taco salad with veggie chili (good but not very good).  Both were under $10 each. They have a nice variety of sandwiches, burgers, salads and daily specials. We ordered some of their bottled beers to go- and check this out -- a 22 oz. bottle is just $3.50 !! They also sell 64 oz refillable growlers ($5 for the growler and $9 to fill) plus three sizes of kegs for all of your entertaining needs.

"Was here last night with a very large party (25, I think)? This was a post-wedding party that was thrown together just a few days before. The area wasn't ready at 4 (that's what time the reservation was for) since there were a few tables that hadn't cleared out yet....but that was the only issue.The organizers/hosts of the wedding opted for a prix fix menu which had a really great selection of items: prime rib, crab cakes, eggplant parmesan, ribs, roasted chicken, scallops, chicken quesadilla, pasta of the day. (I'm probably missing a couple of items...but there was definitely something for everyone).I started with one of the beers - the chocolate stout. It was just what I wanted - a nice, smooth, dark beer. For dinner, I chose the pasta - served with scallops, chopped clams in a chipotle marinara sauce over pepper linguini. Spicy!! Three really good scallops and a ton of chopped clams. Loved it. Lots of other folks at my table had the prime rib and crab cakes. One person got the eggplant and a few others in the group had the ribs. Everyone raved about the food. Dinner was served with a nice fresh, crisp salad and a side of dressing (of choice).They brought out their signature chocolate cake - made with chocolate stout beer and a chocolate ganache frosting. Insanely rich. Instant diabetes. Absolutely delicious.The staff was awesome - smiling, helpful and accommodating. There were a couple of people with gluten issues at the table(s) and they went above and beyond to make sure that they were taken care of.Good food; good beer.",4.0,1

"Service: quick, prompt, friendly and straightforward.Beers: all pretty typical stuff but tasty and very drinkable.Food: pretzels were great, and the mustard that came with the pretzels was really good. Sausages were local and very tasty. Beer cheese soup was pretty excellent. Salad was fresh. Brisket was REALLY bad. I can't even believe they have it on their menu. Dry, chewy, flavorless (for something advertised as ""BBQ Beef Brisket"", pretty sure they've never heard of dry rub). Drowning in BBQ sauce that tastes like nothing. I sent it back and got Buffalo chicken tenders instead, figuring that would be less risky. I was right, they were good, but it's hard to mess up fried food from a bag of frozen tenders.Waitress was accommodating and took the brisket off the check immediately. Girlfriend got a shandy and they put ice in it. If the beer is cold, and the lemonade is cold, why would you water it down by putting ice in it? Weird. She also got Shepherd's Pie. It was pretty good but it seemed like the filling came directly out of a can. She ate the whole thing and it wasn't bad, but we've definitely had better at any number of different places.Anyway, the beers were refreshing after a long hike at nearby Racebrook Falls. We'd do that again for sure. Food was really 50/50 though. The bad experiences stood out more than the good ones, unfortunately. The service was quick and straightforward though, so that was good.",3.0,0
"Terrible. Waited an awkwardly long time to be seated until finally the kind bussers had to get someone to seat us. Again though, we had to keep waiting until a woman rudely walked over, said nothing, and made us follow her into the dining room, throwing two menus onto a table right next to a dirty table then she walked away without a word. It was not at all busy. We stood there for a while assuming this was where we were sitting but unsure.Finally we sat down only to be rudely asked ""do you want anything to drink?"" by the same woman who ""seated"" us. Upon asking for a gluten free menu that they advertised they had online, she snapped ""it's marked right on this menu"". While taking our order, I tried making eye contact but instead watched her look around the dining room with her arms crossed as if she was thinking of better things she could be doing. She also basically walked away in the middle of my order. She didn't tell us anything about the menu, answered our questions as if we were a couple of idiots, and made us feel completely uncomfortable.When the order came -surprise surprise- she got part of our order wrong. But at this point, we just wanted to leave. Food was bland but was fine. If the service had been better I probably wouldn't have even thought about the food.Please address your staff's attitude!!

"Arrived there for the first night of our trip after a local suggested it. Waited over five minutes to be acknowledged. Finally seated and ordered the Bavarian Pretzel as an appetizer. It was 5 super small pretzel sticks that tasted good but hardly enough for our table of 5. Also, it was obvious that they were not made in house. The meal came before long. My two sons each had a hamburger (previously frozen puck).  One came with chips from a bag, the other came with previously frozen broccoli. My daughter had the pita pocket. It was soggy, and had large globs of melted cheese all over the outside of it and the plate. She did not eat it.My husband had a BBQ burger that was super soggy with soaked bits of cooked onion all under the patty. The onions appeared to be from a package. And the burger (like my sons) was made from a previously frozen patty.I made the mistake of ordering the baked chicken. It came with an unclean baked potato that was so dry, that butter and sour cream could not help it. It had obviously been microwaved. And it had no flavor. My seasonal veggies were a medley from a freezer bag that I could have bought at the grocery store. And my chicken (that at least looked appetizing from the outside) was horribly dry with rubbery skin.The waitress never returned to ask us how the food was. Even the manager, who cleared the table did not bother to inquiry why 3 plates (sans the boys hamburgers) had gone untouched.The staff must be used to full plates at the end of the meal that they would rather hurry and get their money than make sure the costumers want to come back. Next time I want a meal prepared by Chef Microwave from prepackaged frozen food, I will go to the grocery store.This place is over priced and disgusting. I hope I have saved you from my mistake of going.",4.0,1
"The beer was great and the sample selection awesome. The food and service left a lot to be desired. The brisket sandwich was a bit cold when it arrived and the taco salad had more black olives, jalapeños and chips then salad or chili.

"As a dog owner, I appreciate that this place has outdoor seating so you can bring your dog.  There were bees and hornets (my husband was stung) though which was distracting from the experience.  The beer was good and we ordered lunch here as well.  The cheese soup was delicious and I highly recommend it.  The sausage platter and Caesar wrap were both okay.  The Caesar wrap was a little dry, since the dressing pooled in the ends of the wrap.",3.0,0

"Very cool brewery restaurant in the berkshire mountain area.  Short little drive from I90.  Definitely worth a stop on the way to Boston.  The place is in an old barn that was converted into a restaurant / brewery.  The beer is solid and the food is even better.  We had the chicken wings and they were amazing.  Super spicy, but didn't kill you.",5.0,1

"Went here for lunch.People were very nice.We ordered the cheddar soup for appetizer. It was ok, bland and the croutons were thrown on top and were awful with the soup.We got two burgers, supposedly grass fed, not sure if that is true. I asked for a medium burger for my son. It was rare inside and burnt on the outside. My husbands burger was bland. My fish was good but the amount of cheese on it was way too much. And I am a lover of cheese. But it was thicker then the actually piece of cod. I literally had to take some off. I would not recommend this place. The only thing I liked was the cuteness of the inside, old and fun. But it needs a makeover for their food. Very disappointing.",5.0,1
"We want the customer experience to be amazing at every turn, Chris, so we're disheartened to hear about your visit. Our food should be delicious and come out exactly how you ordered -- sounds like this wasn't quite what you experienced.

The fish sandwich doesn't usually have cheese on it, I am sure they put two pieces on to accomodate your request. On the other hand, we're glad you enjoyed our staff and ambiance.

"Had an excellent meal at Barrington Brewery this evening. The food and beer were delicious! However, this 5-star review is specifically for the service - we utilized the outdoor dining option and were extremely pleased! The tables were far apart and all staff were masked. Hand sanitizer was readily available. Silverware came in individual baggies. The restrooms were clean, but also contained cleaner if you wanted to make it extra clean. The service was prompt and friendly, and overall it was a comfort experience with awesome food and beer!",4.0,1
"Excellent service and a warm fire made this a great post-snowboarding spot for us recently. For a brewery they didn't have a huge selection of beers but the couple that we tasted were excellent. They have good wings, two different styles: one a smoky Oaxacan with heat and the other a dry buffalo style one (which I didn't care for-not much flavor. I like buffalo wings like my ladies: saucy and spicy). The crab cakes were delicious, juicy and fresh.",4.0,1

"Wow! A solar-powered brewery! Fresh tasting beers, according to those at the table, which they enjoyed immensely. Chicken pesto sandwich, the special, tasted good to my husband with sweet potato fries. Another table mate enjoyed the veggie burger made in the premises. One other table mate had the cheeseburger and was pleased with the amount of cheese on the tasty burger. I had the bratwurst and sausage plate with sauerkraut, mustard and wonderful warm wheat bread, which was deliciously memorable! Our waitress was delightful! Definitely two thumbs up!",4.0,1

"Was pretty pumped to come here after looking on the menu and seeing some great sounding eats and was eager to try out the beers.  It's interesting inside and very dated but I think that's what they are going for?? I mean dated in the way that it looks like my grandmothers basement, old wood, dusty and worn.Went to the bar to try out the brews and had to wait a mighty long time for basically everything--to place the order to try the beers, to place our final order for drinks, place our food order and to get the tab.  I realize there is only one bartender at a ripe age of oh, 60, and this town is veryyyyy laid back and slow...but come on now!Beers were too hoppy and dark for my liking so my girl and I opted for hard cider [yes, my staple thing now.]  I did enjoy the ginger beer and the raspberry one out of all the selections we tried--I def go for the lighter beers. The only cool part was being able to take beers home.  Even then the bartender was drawing all head from them and spilling them EVERYWHERE tho.  Hot damn. There was not One beer that this woman didn't spill. I watched in bewilderment as they all slopped onto the floor and ran over the sides. mmmkkkkk....We ordered crab cake appetizer (two cakes) and the plowman's lunch which was described as apple, apple chutney, sopressata, brie, cheddar, and ale bread.  Well, it was a waste of $20 yo.  The crab cakes were good, but the kind you get frozen from BJ's.  I could have bought a box of them for $10.  The plowman thing was a joke, A JOKE. Half an apple cut up, some gross onion and apple mixture [gag], a few slices of meat, some bits of cheese and a hunk of loaf.  My own fault for not ordering a legit sandwich since I was hungry but even the ppl next to us didn't seem like they were getting anything good with their food either.Perhaps dinner time would be better and worth the price but this was a bust.  Was looking for something more and a tour too!!  We weren't offered any kind of info about the brewing process besides a crudely drawn placemat telling about it...um...ok.  Maybe next time.     MAYBE.",2.0,0
"We had a great time here, and if we had the opportunity to return we'd probably give it five stars. It was that good in all things you want in a restaurant: good food, excellent beers, very friendly, attentive service and quite reasonable prices. We were staying at a motel across the street, and based on advice from other Yelpers, we walked over for dinner. Good decision! The brewery produces some outstanding local beers. We tried the sampler (five 3-ounce brews) and came away preferring the hearty IPA. Our wonderful waitress brought us (unannounced) a Scotch brew which was delicious as well. The Cheddar Ale soup was thick and flavorfully cheesy, a welcome treat on a chilly, rainy evening. The sausage sampler offered a generous selection of lightly flavored meats, each palate-pleasing and accompanied by freshly baked brown bread and a spicy mustard. The chicken pot pie had a huge flaky crust and was filled with chicken pieces and peas and potatoes, all most savory. The restaurant makes their own desserts; they looked incredibly good, but we passed. We now envy those with less willpower. In sum, a very good experience, and we recommend this place highly. It's worth going out of the way for, folks!",4.0,1
"I so want to give this place 4 stars, the beer is outstanding and reasonably priced. I got a sampler and both the pale ale and the seasonal firecracker were extremely tasty. I definitely would go back for the beer.The food and service however, were a totally different story.  My husband got some kind of sausage and I got a California  burger from the specials of the day.  They were both pretty unexceptional. The waiter didn't seem to much about the menu or the beers on tap.  All in all, a fairly disappointing visit.",3.0,0

"We love beer. This beer was flat. Tried two IPA's and don't bother with their sausage sampler either. Sat outside and gnats abounded. Not much more to say. Hard to mess up a brewery but they did. Outside seating - other than the gnats - is dingy. For example ketchup on the chair, folding chair collapsed in when moved forward, fenced in by Home Depot rope, garbage on the crude rock floor. We did tell the waitress that the beer was flat at the table. She said she would let someone know. When she came back with the bill we asked again and she hadn't looked into it. We love breweries and try them wherever we go. We stayed in Becket - next time we will go back to the Westfield River Brewery which blew this place away and is equidistant.",4.0,1
"Leslie.  Our beer is not highly carbonated, it is the way we have make it from the beginning 21 years ago.  The sausages come from a old school German deli in the Catskills that is third generation owned.  As for the Gnats, well welcome to the Berkshires on a summer night.  Hope you can find some joy in your life at the Westfield Brewery.  Good Bye!!",2.0,0
"I have never been disappointed by the food in this establishment.  I am crazy over their salads and their ranch dressing.  I would give anything for the recipe to their ranch dressing I want to take a bath in it-it is so good.  On salads, french fries bread and the fried fish. The deserts are to die for the chocolate tarte and the cake and the cheesecake, seriously sinful stuff.  The prices are modest, the entrees are above average for price, I believe the fish and chips run at $17.00 which seems high.  I usually order the cobb salad which is like 12 bucks.Restaurants in the berkshires run their food prices higher than many restaurants in Washington D.C.-possibly because they have better quality items and have more reliable organic farms etc to find their basic supply for the meals they create.  I am not sure why, but I talk to food establishment owners and they are exceptionally proud of where their food comes from so I imagine the quality is worth it.  The taste is exceptional, and above average in quality, freshness and overall presentation.",5.0,1
"Thanks for the kind words, Jodi! You're right -- we are proud of our dishes and the farms where we source all our ingredients. The Cobb Salad really highlights the great area we're in, and we can't wait to see you back here soon. (We can't give up the Ranch recipe, though -- it's our favorite, too!)

"Not very good. Me and my friends got takeout from here. We got a variety of different foods. Everything was extremely bland. I had the smoked Gouda burger.

"I came here over the weekend with my parents and husband and we all enjoyed it quite a bit. They all enjoyed their beer, which was brewed right there. Forget what they had, though. And we all enjoyed our food. My dad and I had the chicken philly cheesesteak, my mom had the avocado sandwich and my husband had another sandwich, I forget what. We all REALLY enjoyed our meals! My mom got a piece of the ginormous stout cake to go, which I tried. I liked it a lot but I'm not sure I would get a whole piece for myself. It's huge and I think I would take 2 or 3 days to eat the whole thing, and by that point it'd be a 2 or 3 day old piece of cake. I did, however, get the brownie sundae. They make their own brownies and hot fudge and... wow. Just wow. Might be the best brownie sundae I've ever had. It was a generous serving as well. And now I really want another one!The really nice part of this experience, however, was the server. She was VERY friendly and very knowledgeable - she was able to answer every single question anyone had about the beer (how hoppy it is, how it's similar to a European style beer, etc.). Any question about the menu she knew right off the bat, including my dad's random questions about the stout cake. I really really wish we had caught her name because I'd love to give her a shout out here, it's well deserved and unfortunately it wasn't on the receipt. Didn't think to ask at the time. But she was really fantastic.My only two complaints about this place are fairly minor: 1) I wish fries were the standard side instead of coleslaw. They cost an extra $2 to get on the side and while they are very delicious, I don't think you get $2 worth of them on the side... but in my opinion, a much better alternative to coleslaw. So I'd still get them every time. And my second complaint... I'm not even sure how to phrase this. We had an awkward table that had booths on two sides and one chair, the other side of the table was about a foot away from another table, so nobody could sit there. My mom and husband were both sitting in the side of the booth that was facing the other table and it just seemed very awkward. I'm sure it felt very uncomfortable for the two people who were sitting at the table right next to us. Overall, I'd definitely recommend!",4.0,1

"Stopped here for a quick pit-stop on my way to Worcester (always try to stop at breweries when I can). After checking out the reviews on Yelp, I figured how bad can this place be, it brews its own beer and is in the Berkshires.  Well I am said to say I wish I just kept driving to Worcester. Staff was friendly (reason for the 2 stars) but the beer was average at best and the food was aweful.  Certainty I'm spoiled with all the great IPA""s out there (Treehouse, Funk, Neshaminy, etc.) but I was very disappointed with their version.  Light on the hops and rather bland. With regards to the food, I only had the wings as I didn't want to eat a heavy meal and when I was looking over the menu, I actually said to myself ""how can you screw-up wings?""  Well they did...  A soggy, bland offering.  The best thing about the wings was the celery, clean & crisp.",3.0,0
"Stephen, we're disappointed to read this. We take a lot of pride in our beer and our food, and that should always be reflected in your experience. We apologize if that wasn't the case and hope we'll get to make it up to you soon. It seems like we missed the mark with the wings and they were under cooked. As far as our IPA and all of our beers: our Master Brewer studied in Sunderland England and his style and recipes are influenced by English tradition. They are ""drinkable"" and purposefully not too strong in any flavor direction, but far from bland.  The beers you mentioned are all big, bold, American style beers, and you're right, you won't find that style here. We have successfully been in business for 21 years and in 2015 we were among the top 15% across the nation for production. So, while it might not be your style, we know our customers love our IPA. We hope you'll give us another chance when you're in the Berkshires. Thank you for your feedback. Gary and Andrew, Owners",4.0,1
"I will start off by saying that this restaurant is very nice and a good place to stop for a bite to eat when travelling through or staying in the area.  The beer was really good, food was nothing fancy, but good and the atmosphere was comfortable.  Service is what this place lacks...There were a few key players in this establishment who have a little sense of what it means to be in the hospitality industry, but overall, the staff is not on their game.We start with arrival through the front door to the restaurant.  The sign read ""Wait to be seated,"" so we did.  As we walked through the door, I happen to be putting my iPhone in my pocket because I was silencing the ringer as not to disturb other diners.  I also looked at the time, it was 1:18.  We waited.  Staff walked by.  We waited.  Staff walked by.  No one even looked up at us because they knew if they caught our eye, they would have to seat us.  Finally, one male bus boy stopped and said the host would be with us shortly.  We kept waiting.  I started to look at the merchandise in the case on the wall.  We waited.  Finally, a young woman appears from what looked like the kitchen area.  It was now 1:23 on my phone.  It was a beautiful 85 degree day in the Berkshires, so we requested a table outside.  She kindly obliged and were sat at an umbrella covered patio seat.  Menus in hand, we looked over the beer selections.  This being the major reason we stopped in, we always like to know if there are any seasonal beers not listed.  So we waited.  A female server came out to assist the table next to ours who had been sat prior to us.  She took there entire order and returned with waters a few minutes later, never acknowledging us.  No big deal I thought, it's not her section.  A new table was sat a few away from ours and they began to look at the menu.  Several minutes later a different female server appears and begins to assist them.  Still no service and no acknowledgement from this one.  Now it's 1:35 and the first female server approaches us to inquire if we've had a drink order taken.  Finally someone even attempting to say ""hello"" and start service.  She states that she isn't our server, but could get us a drink to start.  While she begins to describe the seasonal beers, our server (female, short black hair, excessive eye makeup) approaches and takes over.She describes three seasonal beers, one being a Bavarian Wheat (hefeweizen I assume) and a raspberry ale.  They both sounded refreshing so we ordered them and one glass of water.  Then we waited.  And waited.  At 1:45, our server appears with two beers, no water.  She places the beers down and we made a comment on the timing of things so far.  She stated, ""there is something going on in there (referencing the restaurant).""  Sorry to hear, but that's not my problem, nor should a server ever mention internal issues as an excuse.  Fake it to make it...servers are actors.  Regardless, she took our food order.  After disappearing, we sip the beers.  One was correct, the other was their blond ale even though we ordered the raspberry.  At 1:54 we flagged down a female bus person who was wiping a table and asked for our server so we could get the right beer...and the water.  She looks confused when we mention that this was the blond and not the raspberry.  There were two sips gone, one from my friend and one from me to verify that it wasn't the raspberry.  She returns with the correct beer.  Finally the water arrives.Lunch was simple, a chicken cordon bleu sandwich, side of fries and BBQ sauce for the fries.  Second was a basic turkey sandwich where you choose the bread, condiments and side.  I ordered turkey on rye, mustard and lettuce, tomato, onion with fries.Food arrives by a food runner, not our server.  No BBQ sauce for the fries.  No mustard for the turkey sandwich.  No onion.  Food runner has to now return with all the requested items.  As mentioned above the food was decent.  Fries were hot and crispy.  Portions were very adequate.Not once during out meal did our server check on the food or our satisfaction with it.  Once I was finished and only had a few fries left, did she appear to ask.  She notices my completely empty glass and asks if I would like another raspberry ale (I was drinking the Bavarian Wheat), I declined.  She turns, walks away and leaves the empty glass on the table.  She returns 10 minutes later to remove our dishes.  We mentioned wanting two souvenir pint glasses to be added to our bill.  This only confused our server more for some reason, but she finally understood. The glasses arrived from a young man (the one who originally acknowledged us at the front door).  The check arrives and it shows us being charged for 3 beers, one of them being the server's mistake that was returned.  UUUGGGGHHHH!  Bill corrected and paid.As mentioned in chapter one of this review (yes it's long), it's a great place to stop for beers and food.  I really hope our experience was isolated.",4.0,1

"MATT: On our way back from Great Barrington, we stopped at the Barrington Brewery for a bite to eat and some local craft beer.  We sampled all of the beers made in-house as well as a cider bottled nearby.  I had a tough decision to make, the sausage sampler, complete with Bratwurst, Bauernwurst, and Kielbasa steamed in beer and served with sauerkraut, or the Plowman's Lunch, a gathering of dried sausage, Brie cheese, chutney, apples, and Ale bread.  I went with the latter which filled me up just enough to sustain me through making my Mama's patented Mac n' Cheese. Adam, what did you think of your Turkey Reuben?

They took away our utensils after the appetizer and then brought the meal but didn't bring any new utensils. It took a while to find someone and track them down for help. The food was also slow to arrive for what seemed to be a fairly slow day for them. It's family and dog friendly which might be a plus for some, but if those things don't concern you then I wouldn't recommend this place.",4.0,1
"Stopped by for a beer Monday afternoon. Interior is rather dated, but feels like a ""tavern"". There were a few people sitting at the bar and it took a few mins for the bartender to acknowledge us. Ordered a couple stouts, which were surprisingly tasty. There were a few bartenders and waitresses but service was disorganized. A couple of guys walked in right before us and we were served first (which pissed them off). The guy sitting next to us complained about his beers being flat. We came to learn (after a few more draws from the tap) the keg was empty and he got the bottom of the barrel. I don't know if they ever poured him 2 new ones. Then a guy came in with 3 growlers and the wrong beer was poured into one of them. We left after one drink, wasn't out kind of place. Maybe we hit them on an off day.",5.0,1
"What a cool spot! I was travelling through MA and had a reservation at the Holiday Inn express across the street and the front desk told me to come here for a bite. Awesome recommendation BTW.The wait staff hurried in my order as I came in 5 min before the kitchen closed. They made quick work with the BBQ and put the sauce on the side. The ribs were awesome. Thank you to the wait staff for being super accommodating and incredibly friendly to me!But let's talk about the beer. For a microbrewery they are unique in that most of their process is powered by solar panels. How that makes for better beer... I don't know, but it's a cool fact non the less. I had a flight and many were solid. Not surprisingly amazing, but definitely a solid lineup of all of your traditional beer, including an ESB! Which I find harder and harder to find. I also had their stout with champagne, which was an interesting combo. If I made it out that way again, this would be a definite stop.",5.0,1

"This place is just OK. We came because it was one of the few dog-friendly (ish) patios we could find in the Berkshires and not too far from our hotel. The service was friendly but forgetful. We never were able to get waters for ourselves or the dog...Food was fine. I went with a burger and it wasn't that great, but others that ordered differently seemed happy with their meals. Beers were OK too but nothing to rave about. It's nice to have the outdoor seating option but I would skip this and do take out and enjoy the outdoors from one of the many picnic areas in the Berkshires.",4.0,1

"I went to the Brewery again because for some reason, people I know still want to go there.  I have been there several times, each time hoping that THIS time will be a good experience.  I think I have given up.This last time was the worst one yet.  We had a reservation, yet still had to wait to be seaed, which is often confusing since the place is busy and waitstaff are running around all over the place.  You never know where you should be sitting or standing while waiting.When we did get seated and our waitress finally took our drink order, it took ages to finally get a drink.  I knew it was not going to be a good sign when she handed us our beers (served in pint glasses) by picking them up by the mouth end of the glass with her fingers.  Uggggh!  Are you kidding me?  That's like Waitressing 101 big no-no.I also ordered sour cream for our nachos, which seems to be like it should automatically come with it, and she never did bring it.  Didn't even acknowledge it.Overall, I think the Brewery is overpriced, with not enough attention to detail, and could use a serious customer service overhaul.  And if I ever am coaxed back into going there again, I will be sure to update my review.  I'm only giving two stars for the beer and the building.",2.0,0
"We crossed the street from our hotel to try the beer and fare.My wife and I both had the Hollander Pale Ale. It was a little hoppier than my hometown brew, Schlafly Pale Ale but not bitter. I really liked it. We had the sausage plate appetizer, with 4 sausage types, all very tasty. I had the NY grill, a open face sandwich of pastrami and corned beef with slaw and thousand island. A Ruben to eat with a knife and fork.My wife had the Philly sandwich, beef, onions, mushrooms and cheese. She liked it but the beef was a little dry.  The coffee and apple/ pear/ raisin pie was great. Portions are large to enormous. Our waitress Tina P was awesome. There when you needed her, courteous, friendly and FAST. If I ever get back to Great Barrington,MA, I will be back to try other beers and eats. I highly recommend you try it.",4.0,1

Great food! We had grass-fed burgers and they were done perfectly (medium was the request)We had a couple of items with a Stout (beer) added as flavor.  I had Cheddar soup and chocolate cake.  However this place added enough to just make it noticeable but not so much it ruins the other favors (which I have also experienced)3 rating because service and decor are 'slow' and maybe a little 'sloppy'It would not take much to make this place a 4 or 5 in my opinion,4.0,1

This place is a favorite! We sat at the bar and had their homemade blond beer and a white wine. We ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with beer battered onion rings and the rueben sandwich.

"Awesome place. Love going to different local breweries when I go out of town. Came here this past weekend with friends and my aunt, uncle and cousin. We were staying at Travelodge and when I saw this place was walking distance I was stoked. We walked in and my family was at the bar. We went over and the bartender let us taste some of the beers. He was really cool and nice. I don't remember his name but he had a pieceing in between his eyes. I think he could definitely tell we were out of towners, though lol. I tried the Hopland Pale and the Iceglen IPA. Both were good. I went with the Iceglen in a pint. While we were waiting for our table (Saturday night, party of 8... we waited a while, but after eating it was well worth it.) my friends were looking around and moseyed upstairs and found two pool tables and a juke box! That was cool. They played some pool while we waited for the table. I hung around the bar, talking to my aunt and whatnot. We sat after a bit and our waitress came over. We all ordered another round. The waitress was very friendly but I don't remember her name. I got a burger, with cheese, avocado and sautéed mushrooms, and it came with fries. The fries were delicious. Everything was awesome. My boyfriend got a sandwich that was smothered in gravy and the gravy was delicious. I got an extra side of it to dip my fries in! It was so good. Everyone seemed to be happy with their meals. After dinner we went back up to play more pool, drink a little more and listen to music. Overall the place was awesome and I definitely suggest trying it if you're in the area!",3.5,1

"A big, popular beer and upscale pub food joint just outside of Great Barrington, Mass.  The vibe was friendly, and I liked the comfortable wooden decor.  The lobster roll I ordered was just all right, but it was reasonably priced and it was nice to have a lobster roll again.  Soups and sandwiches went down very easily and tasted fine.  The beer, which they brew, is solid if unspectacular--they seem to stick to popular styles, so it is not really a beer fanatic's joint.  This is an enjoyable place to visit.",4.0,1
"After visiting for the first time in a long while (I'm talking years) with my wife, it still has the same nostalgia that I remembered. Food was excellent, quick to be served, fresh, and tasted great. Tap selection was great too. The cask ale was delicious (the maibock ale), as well as the barrington brown, both excellent artisan beers in their respective rights. Only downfall I would have to say would be seeing that while being seated, even though it was fast, we were in a corner (which I don't normally mind) we were almost forgotten about by our waitress. Not sure how that occurred, but overall didn't damper our visit in the least. As a matter of fact; my wife and I are actually planning a return visit in the near future (this time bringing an extra guest with us). Overall, great atmosphere, excellent beer, nice place for drinks with friends, or even dinner with your spouse!",5.0,1

"Stopped in after reading the reviews...beer is ok, food was awful, crispy chicken wings were soggy and had 0 spice, pretty sure they were the frozen tyson wings from the freezer section that theu microwaved, nachos are just cheap tortilla chips covered in shredded cheese.The bratwurst (cooked in beer?) had no beer taste...really no flavor at all beside the mustard i dipped it in. Cordon blu sandwich was an out of the bag frozen chicken breast that was super dryed out and tasted like cardboard. The brewers pocket was like eating a bag of spinach, there was no other flavor to it.The service was slow and it took forever to get food. I would definitely not recommend this place or return here",4.0,1

"was here on saturday night with a group of 10 people. the waitress took our drink order right away.  didnt take dinner order until after the appetizers were served and eaten.  took a very long time to clear dishes.but the worst was when she brought out 9 meals. didnt put in one of the orders. things like that happen, it was only a burger though and 15 minutes later he still didnt have his burger. the kitchen should have made that order immediately instead of putting it behind all the orders put in since.  the manager was no help, not even apologizing but saying its very busy. would not go back",5.0,1
"I really wanted to like this place, solar-powered brewery with a restaurant?  Sign me up!  However the following lead me to the 2/5 starts...Atmosphere:It is your typical brew pub, so I really don't care if the place looks a little tired, it is part of the experience.  That being said, the place was a little dusty.Staff and Service:No problems here.  The wait staff were attentive and very nice and the food and brews came out very quickly.Beer:The blonde was pretty good as was IPA and pale ale.  For $5 the sampler you can't beat the flight.  Only issue was the beers lacked carbonation, which kills the full flavor potential.Food:This is really where I was bummed.  My fiance ordered the taco salad and I ordered the grass-fed burger and sweet potato fries.For $10, the taco salad wasn't bad, it is pretty much what you expected, but it was bland on the flavor.The burger for 12.00 (the $1.50 extra for fries and $0.50 for cheese) was a disappointment.  I recognize for grass fed you are going to pay a bit more, but that wasn't the issue.  First of all, the patty seemed frozen and had NO FLAVOR.  Not even salt or pepper.  The only flavor were the pieces of char that came from the grill.  It had essentially been grilled, had some cheese slapped on it and stuck in a bun.  I have had better burgers from a concession stand at a high school football game.  The sweet potato fries were also a bummer, as they weren't even hot.So sadly, this is what I had to say about Barrington Brewery.  I hope they can spruce things up a bit.",4.0,1
"It's a nice small local brewery and it's good to chill out with family and friends after a day's hike.  They have beer tasting for 5 bucks for 3oz each of their beer which is a good value since it's almost like 18oz total.OK, they got one star for beer.They got half a star for food.  My friend ordered their special white clam sauce pasta and I ordered their sirloin steak open sandwich served on their homemade garlic bread with gravy.  Both dishes were not appetizing.  My friend expected either a creamy sauce or a white wine sauce but it was a very watered down seafood broth.  The gravy was soaking the garlic bread so much that I didn't even know what that thing was on my plate.  The sirloin steak was very chewy...I requested for medium rare but it was medium and definitely not tenderized prior to cooking.NOW, to be fair, I did see some of their foods looking better like their shepherd's pie.  My friend ordered the recommended scallops and it was cooked perfectly.So I would say, they should delete some of the items off the menu and leave the dishes that they are good at...no point in keeping unsuccessful experiments.The next 1.5 star is for the wonderful service.  They were very busy but still try to keep everything together.  Our waitress gave us great recommendations (which we should've stuck with), and after dinner, I accidently left my coconut custard pie on the table.  She was kindly to run outside to see if I was still around and gave me my pie.  That is someone who went the extra mile here.  Overall, I will go back for a beer and the usual stuff like chicken pot pie and shephards pie...but not anything different...",2.0,0

"Ya know... I really want to give this place a great review but I'm held back by some reasonable things. To start, my entire night, til 1:30 was spent asking for a drink. The National Championship Game was on their small tv all night but they weren't aware it was a big deal and money maker. Tim the bartender was constantly on the reactive for my drinks and anyone else's. Be assertive, make revenues and tips. Pretty simple. My Stuffed Flank Steak, was hardly Special and I wished I went with the mainstay Shepard's Pie. The Stout was great as I drank them all night but water and refills were flagged down by me and everyone.  I didn't pay extra attention but I wonder if the locals get personal, special attention. My Flank Steak Special was tough throughout and not cooked on the inside. The little Mexican chef (they told me he was) came out occasionally to down shots of something and stated a couple negative comments that made me think he won't be happy cooking here until quesadillas are added to the menu. Actually, continue the sneaky shots of liquor or beer and I'm sure he'll stop undermining the operation.  I'm not sure I would come back if not for inconvenience of another hotel establishment.",3.0,0

A Sunday lunch meant to last an hour took about two and a half... waitress initially came right over to where we were seated on the back patio, and then did not bring waters, even when asked multiple times.

Our waitress was friendly and quick to bring out our first round of drinks and appetizers - but after that it was downhill with regards to the speed of service. The restaurant was moderately busy, but it took ages for our sandwiches to come out. In fact, one other couple seated 2 minutes before us finished their meals and left before we even got our entrees. Considering we ordered the most basic of food items - it was kind of ridiculous. And after the long wait - the food was ok, but not YUM! so I was a bit disappointed.My husband enjoyed the IPA and I loved the Barrington Brown so much that we brought home a few bottles of each. Next time we're out in the Berkshires I'll probably swing in for a few bottles of beer and a slice of cake to go - but I doubt we'll be eating here again.",5.0,1
"Love it!My aunts took me here because I wanted excellent wings. However I am afraid to say that the wings were not up to my par. The spice was nice but they were extremely fatty. I like wings that are crisp and spicy. I love going to breweries and pubs and trying their wings, that's how you call tell if it is a true pub. Nevertheless my aunt and I ate them all up. I had the Pale Ale, which wasn't bad, I am not really an ale drinker but they didn't have the Blonde Ale which I am sure I would have liked a lot.I had the Maryland's Crab Cakes, they were FANTASTIC. I love crab cakes and these were so crisp but soft and just perfectly done. One of my aunts had the chicken pot pie, I don't like cpp, but hers look scrumptious, it was flaky and golden brown and not watered down, she enjoyed it. My other aunt had one of the specials, chicken pesto pasta, it looked good and she really liked it. I love that they give beer bread at the table.We had the stout chocolate cake, it was huge and wonderful. I love chocolate cake that isn't over powered with that chocolate-y taste, it was really great.The only downside was where we sat. It seemed like we were sat with the families and grandparents. This one father was so loud and obnoxious, he screamed at his kid for not wanting to try something he was eating, his response was"" in the family we try everything once."" Good motto for a teenager, but not for a little toddler who was crying. I found our server to be nice, but a little obnoxious as well. I hate when I order a drink they don't even listen to what I want they just assume that I am not 21 and immediately want to see my ID. THEN half the time they don't even look at the date, so why waste your time? That really aggravates me at times.I went back a week later with my boyfriend and one of my aunts. They both had the taste thing, where you get 5 types of beer (you get to choose from a list) I had something light but I can't recall what it was. They had one beer that tasted just like chocolate it was great. For $14 we bought a growler and took it back home with us. Now when we go up to visit we always bring the growler and get to fill it for like $8 it is awesome!But go to the brewery it is awesome, pricey but you won't regret it!",4.0,1
We had a good meal at Barrington Brewery. Not much too look at but really good menu. We both had salads and pretzel bites and everything was delicious. Our server was friendly and we had a good time.,3.0,0
"Friendly service and a great atmosphere! The desserts are delicious but the main courses are seriously lacking. The seasonal vegetables are definitely out of a freezer bag, and the meals have no seasoning at all. It's okay if you're staying at one of the local hotels and dont want fast food.",4.0,1
"Didn't have a chance to eat here while I was passing through Stockbridge/Great Barrington, however, the food did look delicious and a tad bit overpriced.  The beer, on the other hand, is something every visitor to the area should experience at least once.  This was my first time at the brewery and I had heard from a few people what they thought was good and what to pass on.  The selection had changed somewhat from what they remembered, but I decided on a dunkelweizen pint while I perused the bottles to take home.  At $3.50 for a 22 oz. bottle and 4 for $13.00, you cannot pass up the opportunity to buy one of every selection they have on hand.  I ended up buying 8 bottles and they even have nice reusable bags to put the bottles in that hold them perfectly.  The bottles look nice too (as someone there mentioned they were bringing it to a party) with colored foil over the cap.  Since returning home I have only opened 3, but each one has been just as good as the pint I had at the brewery.  Definitely worth the stop if you are in the area.Parking lot on side.",5.0,1
"The beer was good.  Which is probably why everyone reviewing on here gives this place positive reviews - they're drunk.I'm baffled by everyone saying how delicious and fresh the food here is.  It's like the ""before"" of an episode of Kitchen Nightmares.  Everything has very clearly come from a can.  I went with two friends and we ordered a vegetable sandwich, a fried fish sandwich, a tuna melt, some fries, and some onion rings.  It was essentially an inedible meal, which is a near impossibility usually when fries and onion rings are involved.  I ate two bites of my sandwich, and it was the same for my friends.  There were no vegetables in any of the sandwiches, like not even in the ""vegetable"" sandwich - would it kill y'all to slice a tomato?? The cheddar soup was watery, the croutons were burnt, the fries looked like Oreida done wrong.  The waitress was never around, and when she did show up she gave us a lecture about not eating our food.  We left feeling pretty grossed out.The beer was good though.  The shandy was refreshing.",5.0,1
"Only visited once, but I drink A LOT of beer and this by far is some of the best I've had.Some friends and I were staying in the Berkshires and decided to stop in for an afternoon snack. The place was warm, cozy and welcoming. While I was enjoying the flight of beer I ordered, I was read a sign that made me so happy, the Barrington Brewery adds NO PRESERVATIVES to their beer! Being a holistic health practitioner, I was thrilled that the beer I was drinking was:1. Unadulterated2. Contained vitamins B2 and B6 as well as essential minerals like calcium, potassium, silicon and phosphorus. 3. Rich in vitamin B6, which prevents the build-up of the amino acid homocysteine, that has been linked to heart disease. Those of us who have high levels of homocysteine are usually more prone to an early onset of heart and vascular disease4. November of 1999, The New England Journal of Medicine stated that light to moderate beer drinkers would decrease their chances of suffering a stroke by 20%5. The beer making is powered by solar panels! Best. Beer. Ever.",2.0,0
"Divey and just what the Dr. orders after a nice hike in the Berkshires. The beer speaks for itself, so I'll leave it at that. Lastly, regarding the obnoxiously oversized dessert items that great you upon entrance into this gem, I thought they were joking. UNTIL... I shared the chocolate cake with two other people. It's palatable bittersweet chocolate devil's food with frosting akin to your favorite bakery's ganache. Well done, brewery baker!",5.0,1
"Went here with the boy this past weekend as it was recommended by people in the hotel that we were staying at.  We spent the weekend in the Berkshires, and my bf loves good pub food and enjoys a good beer selection, so we assumed this would be a good choice...NOT!Let's start off by me saying that we were greeted very warmly upon arrival, they were bumping!  They clearly don't suffer on the business end.  We were seated within a couple minutes, so that was great.  Our server was less than polite...yes we see it's a busy evening, but really?  Anyways.... on to the food since that's the most important part duh! So much for the great beer selection, they really don't have a lot of drafts to offer, although the stout my bf chose he really enjoyed.  The menu is your basic pub fare offerings.  I opted for the grass fed burger,  and I should have known when I wasn't asked how to have it prepared that it had disaster written all over it.  I had to ""volunteer"" that I wanted it medium rare, and was told that ""well we'll do our best,"" what the hell does that mean?  So it arrives and surely enough, it was not cooked properly, just the very center was barely tinged pink.  The patty itself was either over packed and/or pre-frozen since it was tough and not as juicy as one would expect, very disappointing.  I should have saved the extra buck and gotten regular angus,  and shit..... it probably would have been better.The bf got the pulled pork plate covered in their home made bbq sauce, he LOVED it!  Which was a huge plus, I tried it and it wasn't bad.  He had fries and coleslaw to accompany, he enjoyed both as well.  I'm beginning to understand that he is most emphatically NOT a foodie lol...but that's ok.Such a tourist trap, I kinda had a feeling even before we went but eh.... I am trying to have a more ""mellow"" and ""go with the flow,"" kind of attitude.  We didn't get dessert because we were SOOOO FULLLL on the AMAZING FOOD...yeah right....Truth, we wouldn't have gotten the dessert anyways regardless...I would soooo NOT recommend ever!",4.0,1
"This brewpub has so much potential. The beer is all brewed on site and will probably be one of the freshest pints in the area. I was lucky enough to sample the ESB which was pretty fantastic.However, the staff did not seem very knowledgeable regarding the beers on tap. When asked for a recommendation for the house signature or flagship brew the waitress could only tell me they have several year-round beers and several seasonal ones that rotated in.The food was hot, but otherwise unremarkable. Maybe we just struck out in terms of which apps and dishes we ordered, or maybe the kitchen was having an off night. I ordered the Jacks as an app, which turned out to be not exactly what I expected (a potato cut into 1/5ths length wise with cheese and bacon melted on top). For my meal, I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie. The dish came out piping hot and was a rather large portion. The pastry crust was the star - it was warm and flakey and rather good. Large chunks of white meat chicken were baked with carrots, potato, peas, and I believe some onion. I feel the gravy may have been what was lacking. I can't put y finger on it, but it was missing some X factor that kept the dish from being great. I must repeat - the beer is fantastic here. Do make the effort to try it!",2.0,0
"I honestly can not vouch for the beer here, as I have never consumed it. Not being a beer fan, I have a feeling I'd have a bias towards it at well! Ha!However, I have had several meals here. They've been satisfactory enough. Not terrible, but not great either. I'd say this place is for the beer enthusiast. I can at least attest that several other friends have had positive beer-drinking experiences here...",2.0,0
The food was goodish but the service was horible the waiter was not in a good mood from the start and had no reaspect. To be honest she was rushing the whole table and it seamed like she was just ready to leave. We made a note on the check and she read it like she should. After a cuple of moments she came to the table and was raising hef voice at the table about how the service was perfect and there was no ptoblome at all so there was no reason to make a big deal about it. I live in this town and serve this country and do not diserve the disreaspect i got this evening.,3.0,0
"First time here, I decided to try the beer sampler, afterall, when visiting a brewery, one must sample all the hop infused ambrosia they have to offer. Three little shotglasses of beer later I met the beer that would become my next love, the Barrington Brown....but that was a one-night-stand when at last my tastebuds were molested by the thick, hoppy and subtle flavours contained in the Black Bear Stout. And when I realized that they sold the beer in take aways (appropriately in this case named, ""growlers"")....I gladly succumbed to purchasing some of that nectar to take home with me.But, before I could leave, I spied the coup d'grace of the entire establishment...the stout cake. A massive wedge of spongy, chocolate filled sin. So, in a swan dive of no self restraint...I ordered a piece to whet my palate one last time before my departure....and from that first bite until the last crumb....I knew I had just entered heaven....one glass of stout and one wedge of stout cake at a time.",1.0,0
"I decided to stop at this solar brewed brewpub while on a recent trip in the Berkshires.  When they mean by solar brewed is not that the beer is brewed by the sun, but rather the brewery is solar powered.  I enjoyed a nice blond beer here, but had I known that they offered a flight of beers, I would've ordered that instead (that's my mistake).  The beer was good.  I decided just to munch on an appetizer, which in this case was a sausage platter, which came with their loaf of ale bread (a lot like wheat bread).  I found this to be tasty and was able to make small sandwiches out of the sausage and bread.  Definitely stopping by here again when I am in Great Barrington again.",5.0,1

"Just went here and the food was great and the beer was excellent. We did have a waitress who to put it simply was exceptionally rude. She complained about having to split a check, yelling at 4 younger people about having to split their bill 4 ways. We were told by a fellow customer how patient we were with her, and how she had managed to break several cardinal rules of serving just in his brief listening to our interaction. Hopefully she will not be around too much longer to taint others experiences at this amazing restaurant. I have the Smoked salmon BLT and my girlfriend had the garden veggie burger and both were awesome. We both had the Bavarian wheat beer and it was so good we both wanted more but sadly had to drive home. I highly recommend the food and drink here so delicious. Thank you to the manager for following our waitress and cleaning up after her, you were kind and excellent. 5 stars for food and drink 1 star for server",5.0,1

"I have been here numerous times now, whenever I come up to Mass I have to visit here.  And tell everyone I know the same.But this time I kind of looked like a fool.  I really really hope this was an off night.  Our server was pretty non existent.  Meanwhile I went on and on to my bf on how great this place was and the food and the service singing the breweries praise.Beer was on point as always, same as the food.Ale bread was out of this world!But there is so much potential here.  The staff (minus the bar) didn't know what beers were available and what each one was.  Our server didn't even let us know the special beers for the night.  When I walked over to buy a growler at the bar to go home with I saw them, and was disappointed I had no idea they were available.Please Barrington Brewery...I love you guys...hoping this was just an off night, keep the awesomeness that is the Barrington Brewery I love and remember.",3.0,0
"Solar powered brewed beer. And it's brewed onsite! And it's GOOD!After looking at the adjoining Crissey Farm as a possible wedding ceremony and reception location, we headed over to the brewery for lunch. We wanted to try their food, but mainly we were interested in the beers they brew on site. It really impressed us that we would enjoy brews made on site but ones that were brewed using solar power. We had the Berkshire Blonde and the Raspberry Ale, which were both beautiful beers with lovely hues and even more enjoyable tastes.Besides the beers being great the food was enjoyable too! We each has sandwiches and shared an appetizer of potato skins. The decor is fun for a brew pub with old pictures and steins from the past 2 hundred years or so. Just take note that the restrooms are small and don't have changing takes for kids, although there were a lot of families there.There is plenty of parking in the lot outside.",4.0,1
"Stopped by on a Thursday night for dinner while on vacation.  My husband had some of their beers and enjoyed them enough to get  a few bottles to bring home.   The food was adequate. Definitely not memorable.   We started with the Ploughman's lunch, which is a cheese plate.   My husband had the herb roasted cod.  It's been a little over a week and I think I had the chicken quesadilla.   As I said, adequate, but not memorable.   The service was OK, but it was obvious our waitress really didn't want to be there.   The whole place could also use a good cleaning.   In a pinch, I would go there again if in the area.",3.0,0
"The food was ok. Nothing jumped off the menu as a ""must order"" and what we got wasn't noteworthy, but hit the spot. The bartender was a nice enough guy and was quick with the refills. The interior had a bit of a barn feeling which fits because they brew their beer in the barn next door. They have two tvs located at the bar, but their mugs for the mug club hang in the way so it was tough to follow the game. Just about everything about this place screamed average, with one exception. You gotta try their beers. The beer might've been the best that I've had at a brew pub. Their Octoberfest was nothing special, but their Pale Ale, Dunkelweisen, Nut Brown, and even their light were all great. Eat wherever you want (but there don't seem to be a lot of good options on route 7 outside of town), but if you're a fan of trying new beers then you need to stop here for a couple.",4.0,1
"We just came here for the beer on a vacation weeknight. There was understandably hardly anyone at the bar, but we had a good time, largely thanks to the bartender.I ordered a flight of five beers, and all were very good. I especially liked the porter and the stout, but maybe that's just me. For my girlfriend, who isn't a huge fan of beers, the 'tender offered her a Pale Ale Cocktail made with ginger ale and lime. A nice ""girly drink"" selection indeed.Apparently bored, the bartender also gave us a few free samples of other beers and strange concoctions of multiple beers. He earned his tip, that's for sure.It should also be noted that this is a very cool place. Decorated like an old-fashioned brew pub should be, with old crap on the walls, dark wood, and beer making equipment everywhere.",4.0,1
"We stopped here after hiking Mt Alander on a very hot sunny day.  They advertise as the 'solar powered' brewery.  That sounded pretty cool so in we went with high expectations.  My wife had the 5 beer sampler,  I had a  pint of blonde ale, and tasted most of the sampler too.  The bartender was extremely sloppy pouring.  A couple of the small glasses were mostly foam.   The paddle they were on was more or less tossed down the bar towards us.   Nice.  The beer was average, which when it comes to beer would normally be enough to entice me to have another round.   I'm easy that way.  But I had a hard time with the crappy bartender.   No respect for the beer or the customer.  We got up and left,  which may have been the first time I've ever done that at a brew pub.  It wasn't that busy, so there's no excuse for her.  We have some more poking around to do in this pretty corner of the state, but I think next time we'll stop at the nearby Mexican place which had a nicer looking outdoor patio.  There's no need to ever visit this place again,  we'll leave it to the New Yorkers who have overrun the area.  Maybe they appreciate the attitude,  but we did not.",2.0,0

It is adequate at best. The menu is simple and on top of that not even done perfectly. Had a salad with chicken and the chicken was hot off the grill causing the salad to be warm and wilted. The house shallot vinnegrette was almost all oil and not very tasty. French fries, while crisp and salty, seemed to not even contain potatoes. Fish and chips were good, as was the buffalo chicken.

Non-vegetarians who think this is acceptable don't understand how to cook veg. My wife had to add tartar and ketchup for flavor. the additional $1.50 for four, yes 4 onion rings was steep compared to other restaurants.

"I give the beer 5 stars. The service was 5 stars. The food, price wise was 3 and the quality was 3 on average but no stars for my meal. The place was full on this Saturday and the people were standing at the door. My wife and I met another couple and their son here for dinner. We all drove 2 hours to eat here and my friend left with two growlers of stout, light body but tasty. He had the chicken salad, she ordered the arugula and the son a steak. They thought the prices were a little high for salads, expecially the arugula. Steak was fine. My wife liked her chili but thought the portion was not ""bowl"" size as ordered and smaller than imagined. I had a $10 fish sandwich. No fries came with it, just coleslaw. I thought that was overpriced. I  had eaten 1/2 the sandwich when I took a bite that tasted funny. When I took the next bite, an odor went right up into my nasal cavity of the sort that reminds one of a tooth infection. I spit out the food. My friend asked what was up and I told him. He replied that he noticed an off smell from my meal, but didn't want to say anything, trusting that it would be fine. Now we both knew that it wasn't. I told the waitress about the fish being ""bad"" and took it off the check. She did offer to bring me another sandwich but after the bad taste, i didn't have the appetite.  I had a some stomach discomfort for awhile but I didn't get sick I guess it will be only for beers and appetizers if we return. I cannot believe that we have never had a perfect meal here.",2.0,0

The following accounts have occurred over the last four years, as we only visit the Berkshires two or three times a year. The first time we waited for to be seated upon entering by the bar. We were ignored by the bartender and another waitstaff although they gave boisterous greetings to the local patrons. I think we have to move here to get their attention. We left, emailed the manager and complained, receiving a complimentary certificate. Second time, waited a long time to be seated and got a grumpy waitress. Third time, so there is an atmosphere, a pattern emerging) I waited to be seated, finally got seated, waited, waited, had to go to the bathroom, returned to find the hostess and waitress staring at my table,wondering where I went. I explained as they returned with my menu. I again seated myself, waiting for the waitress to return to take my order (she left with the hostess). Finally, I left the restaurant where the manager passed me and wished me a nice day. We returned again during the summer of 2014 and wanted to have a couple of brews in their outdoor area. We were told that area required a food purchase as well so if we only wanted a beer, we had to go outside the area to the parking area and sit on a bench. The ""team"" is off there. Too many fouls and incompletes to warrant a ""must go to"" when we are in the area. Our friends have noted similar ""off notes"".  As another mentioned, a dusting and cleaning would be nice.

If people come to a restaurant at 6 on a Saturday on a holiday weekend and they have to wait at the door for a table, well that's how it goes.

The buffalo chicken sandwich was too greasy and made me feel sick.  Same goes for the beef cheesesteak sandwich and pretty much everything else we have ordered as a main course.We are still planning on trying the Chocolate cake - but my advice for anyone is go, drink beer, get some appetizers, maybe some cake, and call it a day.",4.0,1

Started with a half rack of ribs and the meat fell off the bones and were in awesome bbq sauce. The place can use an upgrade but all in all a solid friendly place you want to be.",4.0,1

"Got in the tavern area, asked nicely that Game 7 Eastern conference NHL final be put on 1 of 3 TVs.  The waitress changed it right away.  Half hour later, the bartender changes all of the TVs in the bar to the NBA game.  Did not even ask if we were watching the game. Jerk!  We were looking forward to this all day.  The NHL game started while we watched commercials for 1/2 hour before the NBA game started.  The couple beside us said they wanted to watch the NBA game so we did not complain.  So we finished our meal quickly and left to go watch it in our hotel room.  And my fish and chips was not worth savoring.  My son said his steak and stout was poor as well.",5.0,1
This place is a must stop for us each time we come out to The Berkshires. We fill up our growler and stock up on some 22 oz bottles. Food is great and very reasonable. Love watching the bar staff use the old school cash register to ring up everyone.,4.0,1
"Cheddar. Cheese. Soup. I mean, does it get any better?Excellent spinach salad with awesome ranch dressing (got it on the side and could have taken a straw to the container!)Big guy loved his roast beef and cheese sandwich, I barely got a bite. Little guy totally dug his mozzarella sticks (did your mom let you eat cheese for a meal when you were a kid? Neither did mine. Lucky dude!)Of course the beers were tasty and strong but with a drive ahead of us we didn't do much damage at the bar.Get the dark chocolate and stout cake: one piece will feed four people with leftovers, it's so big but has fabulous flavor and texture.",5.0,1
"The Berkshires has some of the best food in the Northeast. One stop that my family makes almost every weekend we are there is the Barrington Brewery and Restaurant. Their food is fresh and we love it.Call me crazy but i have never had a bad meal of beer while dinning at the Barrington Brewery and Restaurant. Fresh, Fresh, Fresh!!!!!This past weekend i enjoyed the brisket and my wife as usual ordered the veg chili/ salad combo.  We always say we are going to order the 7 layer chocolate cake but we need an army for that task.The staff is great, friendly and helpful.  If you are in Great Barrington drive through town and head towards Stockbridge for a great time and meal. They are always busy and do not rush you out. Remember everything is made to order.",4.0,1
"Nestled in a meadow surrounded by beautiful fall foliage, the Berkshire brewery has unique Decor. The wait on a sat night was 20 minutes. From the bar. You could see equipment used from their solar brewing equipment. Coasters from all around are plastered to the walls. Above the bartenders hang personal steins reserved by select patrons. After being seated, service was quick. The seasonal octoberfest beer was delicious. Food was decently priced.  I had the brisket and ribs and as soon as the BBQ sauce touched my lips, my jaw dropped. It was tangy with a smokey flavor I couldn't get over. The ribs were fall off the bone tender and went great with the brisket. The beer battered french fries were awesome but the cole slaw that came with the bbq plate was a little soggy and sub par.",4.0,1

"I am a from birth native of G.B. but not currently.  I am not a beer snob so can only say it was beer. I had the sampler. I tend to be tolerant of things not being perfect.  Hey we all have bad days. But here is what we experienced.My wife had a dark beer, felt the dark beer, dunkel___, can't finish the end because the handwriting on the menu was not legible, was the best dark of what we tried.  The 2 stars is for the food service.  Thursday lunch and not packed.  Slooowww for the food to arrive (we guess at least 25 minutes).   I had the ""Chicken Philly"".  My wife had the ""Brat"" (on the same sub sandwich bread as the Philly).  We both agree, the bread was very dry like it was days old.  My other complaint; the ""Chicken Philly"".  The chicken is NOT sliced thin, Philly style, .  The chicken is breast meat in large long chunks, so don't expect to bite into a sandwich you think is philly style.  The flavor was fine.  Needed salt but better needing salt than having too much.Conclusion;  Due to the lackluster food and labeling something it is NOT, Chicken Philly,  and slow service does not draw us back for the food.  Oh, the fries are good.",2.0,0
"Ray, just to clear up any confusion: the menu reads: ""sliced chicken breast"" for the chicken philly sandwich. When we say ""Philly style"" we mean that the chicken breast is served with similar dressings and bread as a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich is, not that the meat is sliced in a similar way. We get our rolls fresh from a local bakery every morning,  so we're surprised to hear you say you weren't pleased with the bread. Day-old bread becomes croutons.  We hope we'll have a chance to show you what's more typical around here soon. As for the Dunkelweizen (dark-wheat): We will try to be more diligent about hiring staff with better hand writing so our chalkboards are easier to read.

Quick stop in for lunch and really enjoyed it.  Casual a lot of people but no wait time. I had blue cheese burger w bacon. Great flavor along with great service. Was a good choice.,5.0,1
Love this place and everyone I bring here loves it.When the weather is nice it's a great place to go on a bike and have lunch outside in their large outdoor eating area.  If you do go outside to eat when it's busy you may have to get your servers attention on occasion. Inside is cozy and pub-like and the service is great.  I've only really had the pub food but its the best I've had anywhere.  Very authentic tasting and big portions.  Personally I love the plowmans lunch with a hearty beer.The beer is great and I highly recommend getting their sample board of beer.,5.0,1

"Food (burger and fries) was inedible.  Service was terrible.  Ordered the burger extra well-done, it came out rare.  Sent it back.  It came out again, eventually, but it was like they sprayed the plate with a layer of grease, to the point where the burger couldn't be picked up.  The meat itself was substandard, low-quality---nowhere near as good as fast food joints.  The server came once to take our order, then never saw her until the check arrived.  A bus-person brought the food back and forth from the kitchen and clearly didn't care about customer service.  This was disgusting.  If there was a zero star option I would use it.",3.0,0

"Had dinner with my wife.  Hot and cold here so here I go with my review.   My wife ordered the steak, it was great, the vegetables were severely undercooked    I had the cod over spinach, they tried to make it tasty with herbs but it was pretty bland.   The server, well let's say she was lucky, she never asked my wife how she wanted her streak cooked, luckily it came out medium rare and perfect.  She also never told us the specials and never asked for starch choice.  Again she nailed it with the baked potato.   I had the Ice Glen IPA (actually 2) and took a growler to go.   I do like this place.  They just need to step it up a little in the kitchen and the service.",3.0,0

"By today's standards, the beer here is unremarkable.  This is a brew pub that is stuck in the first wave of the mid 90's craft beer movement.  (The one that nearly put the industry in the tank.)  Beer is not good here.  Food is the same. Bland, small portions and again, unremarkable.  Bartender was a one-hander, rarely using both hands, and was completely overwhelmed with the task at hand.  She was pleasant but not genuinely so.  Clearly going through the motions and burnt out. 2 stars given to the atmosphere.  Cozy pub feel here, but that is about all they have going for them.",1.0,0

I had a chef's veggie burger and swapped out the daily side of cole slaw for beer battered fries. I skipped the brew. The burger was ok and the fries were good. My waitress took my order and then I only saw her around the room. She never came back or asked how things were. The woman who seated me finally came to clear my plate and I had to ask her for the check. She then had to get my waitress to get my check. I hate waiting 10-15 minutes longer than necessary just for a check. That's what affected the rating.,4.0,1
Beer was good.  Had some dark beers which are my favorite.  Place was small there was an hour wait on a saturday night. But the food just wasnt taste it was just eh. So that was why the three stars.  We played pool upstairs while we waited for a table.  Dirty dishes everywhere.  Could have been cleaner.,4.0,1
"Sorry about that wait, Scooby. We were crazy busy the week you came in, so sometimes that means a little bit of a longer wait and our team gets tied up in the dining room.

"We were here for dinner earlier this evening (August 16) at about 6:00, got there right before the dinner rush & were seated in the 1st dining room at the top of the stairs. We were a bit slow ordering because everything sounded good, but instead of being met with a helpful server to navigate the menu, we felt like we were an inconvenience from the start. We were visiting from out of town & me from out of state & honestly the food was really good, but instead of staying for the giant slice of chocolate cake I was eyeing since I sat down, we chose to leave as fast as we could. We were not told about the specials, I had to get up myself to go look, we weren't brought plates for our appetizer, we all asked for water & 1 glass was brought, we had to ask for bread that came with the meal & it seemed like a huge effort for some to be brought to us. Meanwhile we see the tables next to us get offered a free sample of beer to try or their server greet them like they cared. The girl up front seating people & the guy who bussed our table were both very courteous. 2 stars for the bad service...hard pass next time.",5.0,1

"The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere definitely feels like a beloved local brew pub, but the food and beer are just okay.  Our waitress was very helpful suggesting other restaurants and bars to visit during our weekend stay in Great Barrington. We ordered a double tasting flight to go with out meal. The nice thing about the flight is that you aren't committing to a pint of any one of their mediocre beers. We ordered a salad, the potato jackets with broccoli and cheese, and a veggie burger. The salad had dry, wilted arugula and the potato jackets were standard baked potato-skin fare, but the steamed broccoli made the entire plate a watery mess. The beer battered french fries served with the veggie burger were the highlight of the meal.",3.0,0

"I LOVED THIS PLACE!!!My husband and I came here this past weekend for a small getaway.We live in Jersey City. Some of the food, like the crab cakes were frozen. Most of the food was fresh, and the prices were VERY reasonable and so were the portions. The dessert is made on site and you get HUGE pieces of cake. The grass fed burgers kept me coming back everyday of our trip.The BEST part is that they sell beer to go. Its their own seasonal beer they brew on site and the brewery is solar powered. The growler was $5 and the beer is $9, so if you bring the glass growler back to them for a refill, its only $9. We bought 3 growlers to go. I am not a huge beer drinker, but I had to admit they were great. This place gets pretty crowded and always had room. Plus it was the ONLY place that was open and willing to sell us beer after all the other places closed at like 9pm on a Saturday night. I'd definitely come back again if I was in the area.",5.0,1
"Much better visit this time around. Even though it was Mother's Day and place was busy, server was on her game. Food was solid -- we had a veggie burger, salad and a first-rate chicken pot pie.

"Interesting to read some of the previous reviews because they echo my main complaint -- service (or the lack thereof). It took forever to get recognized by a host to be seated (meanwhile servers whizzed by ignoring us). It took forever to place an order. It took forever to get our food (and we started with soups!) and drinks. No water or bread was ever offered. Server did check at one point to see how things were, but that was about it. Host/manager never visited and when a restaurant is clearly off its service game, a host/manager should know to come by to suss things out and see how patrons feel. (And it's rare I say this, but host/manager was dressed a little too casually -- as if nothing really mattered in terms of making a good impression.) As for the food itself, cheese soup was solid (but served tepid -- I'm guessing it was sitting out for a few minutes before it got to our table), onion rings and wings were nothing to write home about. Hard to see if the entrees would have been worth it. I will say the chocolate stout cake lives up to all its hype -- and it almost redeemed the meal. (Well, the beers were tasty, too.) But when service is this lackluster it's hard to say if I'd make a return visit. There really is no excuse for this sort of basic disregard for your customer.",4.0,1
"My wife and I make a point of going to breweries whenever we travel.  Barrington is novel in that it uses local ingredients and solar power.  We had a sampler, and none of the beers were bad.  The Farmouse ale was particularly good, and I had a couple pints.  The raspberry wheat beer was probably the best fruit wheat beer I've ever had, and I tend to dislike them.  The Black Bear Stout was smooth and creamy.  The IPA was bland, and the Brown tasted overly toasted.The food was good.  My wife ordered a burger with sauteed onion and peppers.  The waitress did not ask how she'd like it cooked, which was weird, but it was cooked perfectly and was very good.  The chips that came with it seemed to be Ruffles out of a bag, which was sad.  I had the open-face Reuben, and it was very good, covered in cheese and with the right amount of sauce.  The cole slaw was also very good.  We shared a caramel chocolate tart with pecan crust, and it was fabulous.  The food prices were high, which seems to be typical for the whole area, but the beer prices were reasonable.We went in around 4pm, so we could not order from the dinner menu, and there were only a couple other people in the place.  It seemed to be a place for local regulars, and the staff chatted and gossipped with the other customers, but we got served quickly.  The bathroom was clean, but only accomodates one person at a time.I would come here again for more of the Farmhouse ale and to try the stout cake, and I would make sure to come in before the dinner crowd.",4.0,1

Great food, great service.",4.0,1
"Pretty decent as far as pub food goes. I got the raspberry beer which was very good and the steak and cake combo. The crab cakes were ok, not great, not terrible but i did find some lumps of crab which was good. The steak was a 7 oz ny strip which was cooked medium (the waiter never asked me how I wanted my steak done). I normally like my steak med-well but the medium wasn't too bad.

Prices weren't expensive either. I think 2 meals with 2 sodas, 1 beer, and an appetizer I this it was $54. Nice place to sit and having good food and company.",2.0,0
"I had wings here 15 yrs ago that i havent been able to stop thinking about ever since. They were plump, baked, crispy and simply out of this world good.  Went back today and was thouroughly disappointed. Winfs were small, mushy and not very tasty.  Sent back veggie chili also.  Fries and beer were good but everything else (mozz sticks, chk philly) was subpar.",2.0,0

"Very friendly service but their beer just doesn't do it for me. Having tried it a number of occasions, I just can't get into it. Something always seems a little off. Food is pretty good.

"Don't blink, cause you'll drive right by and that would be a shame!  This small brewery/restaurant is where we stopped for lunch on visit to the area. We had the burgers and the cobb salad.  Everything was fresh and tasted great.  The beer is good too!  Especially considering the available selection in the general Berkshire County area, this is a gem you shouldn't pass up.  Casual, rustic atmosphere and low to moderate prices. The only complaint we had was that service was a bit on the slow/inattentive side, but that didn't detract from the overall experience.",3.0,0

Atmosphere is a 80s time warp, immediately comfy, not pretentious, great if you like that, bad if you want a fancy setting. Service was efficient, accurate, not trying to be best friends.

"Went to this restaurant after seeing its specials listed on their website.  Flabbergasted to find that they had not updated the site in nearly a year.  The special we came for was not available and they were not very accommodating.  They nickel and dime their customers charging for cheese on your chili.  Expect to pay $15 for Shepard's pie, etc (pub food).  At $4.50 for a glass of beer I would expect more.",4.0,1

"Really love the fact that we have a Brewery like this in town. Its exactly what you want out of a local Brewery - intimate dimly lit Pub Room, Pub tables throughout the restaruant area with great Pub food. They have good Burgers and sandwiches- also have Chili and Steaks and other american fare. The Beers are great. My favorite is the IPA but its worth giving any of the other beers a shot.",5.0,1
"Stopped by on the way home from skiing. Hard to see from the road. Ample parking, great atmosphere. The restaurant is located in a barn. The service is average.The food was nothing special, I had philly cheese steak (about $12) and beer battered fries. Tried most of the beers they offer. I would recommend all the beers except ""black bear"" stout and raspberry ale. The ""black bear"" stout is similar to Guinness, only not as smooth and has an intense aftertaste, and the raspberry ale is just light beer with a hint of raspberry . But I guess its a matter of taste. All the other beers were exceptional. Great part is the price of beers, its a pretty good value at $4.75. Oh yea...never take the stout mixed with champagne that they have in the beer menu. Disgusting taste, sour mixed with chocolate. I still scratch my head in confusion that someone came up with such a thing. The beer really makes this place worth coming back for.",4.0,1
I have been going to this restaurant for over 15 years -  -- in the summer you can eat outside and in the winter the wood stove is going -- the cheddar ale soup is my favorite the best I have ever had.

"I had a delicious IPA and brewers salad. The salad (greens, cheese, ham, turkey, carrots, hb eggs) was large, fresh, and well put together. The IPA was hoppy with a surprising rich/malty finish. Our server was friendly, funny,and gave us plenty of attention on a busy Friday. And the prices are plenty reasonable.",5.0,1
"Lots of great beer (wish I'd tried a flight since both the beers I had were so delicious) and a nice pub menu.  One of the specials of the day was a grass-fed beef burger with cheddar, buffalo sauce, and lettuce-tomato-onion, plus beer battered fries.  It was just what I wanted.  My wife had a nice fried fish sandwich and we split a house salad, which includes chick peas - a nice bolt of added protein!  As newlyweds we of course had to try the Wedded Bliss seasonal beer, which is a lovely refreshing lager, and as a hops fan I had to also have the Farmhouse Ale which featured two kinds of regional hops (one local, one from Maine, if I recall correctly) and tasted to me like a well-balanced IPA.  We got some bottled beer to take away - be advised that they sell the bottles cold!  I was not expecting that and I'm hoping they won't suffer too much from warming and later re-chilling.",5.0,1
"Ok...I have to start by saying the food and beer were perfect. The food is always good actually, the beer, always better. Now, let's talk about the service....I haven't been to this place in over a decade and thought it would be a great place to grab dinner to celebrate a birthday. I'll walk you through my experience:We arrived through the rear entrance and waited to be sat. We waited for a while. This was a Tuesday evening and it was moderately busy. It looked like all servers had a table or two, only one or 2 7-10 tops, so not a crazy night. Well, we couldn't do anything short of firing a flare gun at the hostess to break her, clearly, great conversation with a table on the patio. The bar tender could see that we were waiting, trying to be patient (patient and hungry don't blend well) and would pass by and say ""She'll be right with you guys, sorry for the wait"" etc. You could see that he was annoyed with his co-workers. The bartender was the one staff member that I saw essentially taking the entire restaurant on himself while the rest of the staff grumbled and moped about. So to you sir, thank you! He is also who eventually sat us (after about 25 - 30 mins)because that conversation on the patio was just too good to leave.  We were finally sat at a table and had time to decide on drinks, entree, if we wanted apps, what dessert would be awesome, what the weather was like, and every other bit of small talk until we finally met our server. And what a ball of fiery enthusiasm he was! Oh that...that's sarcasm. Mopey is putting it lightly. I'm not sure if the majority of the staff got yelled at, or had pay cuts, or what, but they were not in a good place. That all being said, we ordered, had a round of beers (before the meals came), and had a relatively good ol time. When the entrees came out, our glasses were all empty, and the server did not take any time to notice. Dropped food and ran. To what, I don't know. Like I said before, it wasn't the busiest night. Even when the server did his obligatory ""How is everything"" while my mouth is full, he still didn't take note of empty glasses and he ran away before I could swallow enough to ask for a refill. So we ate our meals with dry glasses, and my Father actually had to flag down and ask for refills on our drinks. Hell, I even tried cracking jokes, etc to lighten the mood, make sure the server didn't feel like we were just a bunch of pissed off people that had to wait, but alas, nothing. The food was great, as stated before, as well as the beer. Always incredible. I was overly disappointed in the service. I would go back, but not before reviewing other option in the area. This service really tarnished the Barrington Brewery for me.Now, I do have a service industry / food industry background, so it bugs me when people can't cut the mustard, suck it up, and do a great job. In my mind, my Tips paid me more than my hourly, so I was one pleasant, attentive mother fucker! I LOVE having great servers, and boy do I tip well when I have one. It's a shame when that isn't the case because I really hate giving shitty tips, but if your service is consistently crappy, expect your tip to be as well. I see from other reviews that service is the main complaint. Take note guys. A bunch of pissy, entitled college kids coming home for the summer aren't always the best option for good staff. If that's not the case...I hope you have some great applicants soon. Thanks for the great food and beer! Cheers.",4.0,1
"The hostess is crazy and rude! She runs around the restaurant barking at staff members, slamming doors, and ignoring guests.  My husband and I came in a few minutes after our friends got there and attempted to sit down and join them. Instead the crazy hostess yelled at us in front of the whole dining room!

This place should close the restaurant and stick with the only thing they do well, beer!  Will never go back.",2.0,0

"Always liked the Brewery untill a recent visit. The bar was being renovated, so beer was being served in soft plastic containers, the kind used at a picnic. After four beers in these junk containers, we received a tab of $18.00 dollars. It was the same price as a pint (16oz ) even though it was only 12 oz. Since the price, or notice was not posted, I complained. The complaint fell on deaf ears, and the owner offered me one 12oz beer in a soft plastic container at this time only, not for the future..

I was hoping to enjoy my beer, the English ale, which was quite good, but our food came really fast, like less than 6-7 minutes from ordering. I was only 1/2 way done my beer and wanted to order another but the food was already there. We finished eating our meals which were really excellent. The salmon BLT was outstanding. The waitress came at the end and seam bewildered that we didn't want drinks after we had eaten. We left and were out the door by 5:10. If we were to do it again at 4:30, we would got to the tavern in the back for a couple of drinks first and then go to dining room after 5.

"A summary of the events: Screaming children, crammed seating, the overwhelming stench of beer, hacking coughs from nearby tables, poorly mannered patrons, and absent wait staff. We start the night by walking into a crammed restaurant, no hostess. She finally comes to tell us we have to wait 15 minutes, even though we see several empty tables. She then returns and tells us she was wrong, and seats us next to both the stairs and the darts, seemingly a magnet for elementary school kids who love to scream. Our waitress comes, another returns with out drinks, 15 minutes later she comes back to fill out drinks, long after they've been empty. Another child coughs and coughs, just as my food comes. Yum. My ribs were mediocre, my date's potato skins were lukewarm, and ""not very good"".

"First of all, this review is not about the food or the beer ... simply because we didn't even get that far.  My husband and I were gifted a weekend stay at a nearby inn and we thought Barrington Brewery would be a great place to get some dinner and locally brewed beer (for him, not me).  We walked in about 7:00pm on Saturday night and were met with a chalkboard sign that said ""wait to be seated.""  So we did ... and then we waited some more ... about 10 minutes passed and not one single waitress or the harried hostess even greeted us.  I walked towards the bar to see if there was a hostess stand, but was only met with yet another chalkboard sign at the other entrance.  The hostess finally came over, asked us how many, and then hightailed it towards the bar area, not even telling us the customary ""follow me.""  She then proceeded to slap down our menus on a corner table in front of the bar and walk away.  She said nothing to us ... no ""here you go,"" or ""your waitress will be right with you"" ... just slapped down the menus and was on her way.  Since at that point we were starving (and there's really nothing worse than a starving pregnant woman) we decided to stick it out despite how rudely we were treated by the hostess.  We looked at the menu, which contained extremely overpriced and ordinary ""bar food"" (seriously - $18 for fish and chips?) for about 10 minutes before we decided to leave.  A waitress never even came by and we were sick of being ignored.  My recommendation is that this place get a proper host/hostess stand, replace the awful woman they had doing the job on Saturday night, and improve their menu/lower their prices.",1.0,0
I was excited to try this place out while I stayed at the hotel across the street but was severely disappointed. I love places that brew their own beer so I always try to hit them up. The beer was just mediocre compared to similar places and my own home brew. The food though was just terrible. I got the grass fed burger with BBQ sauce. What a joke. The burger was completely tasteless and the BBQ sauce was disgusting. My wife ordered the fish and chips which was also flavorless and soggy. Both items are staples at pubs and to make them so poorly is a disgrace.,1.0,0

Really, we would have walked out if there was any place nearby to go. Maybe that's their trick. Anyway, once seated we ordered right away only to have them serve our food to the table next to us.

"this review does not pertain to the food or our waitperson, on may 1, 2013 my mom and i stopped at the brewery for lunch as we usually do when in the barrington area. we had always enjoyed the food and service;  i need to explain my mom had a stroke 4 years ago, she fought to overcome the residual effects however, she was left with expressive aphasia. after lunch my mom had thought she might like dessert, while she was deciding, i went to the ladies room, on my way back to the table i heard a co-worker (who had shown us to our table) say to our waiter "" what does that crazy old lady want now ?"" i felt he was referring to my mom, when the waiter returned to our table i told him i had heard the remark and wasn't happy about it; he apologized and said he was very sorry about the comment. i walked my mom to the car and decided before i left i would get a contact number for the owner. i asked a waitress for this information and she replied the owner was there and she would get him, she  walked over to the man who had made the remark, after waiting a few minutes he came over to me and asked what i wanted; i told him i had heard what he said and i didnt appreciate it..he said he "" didn't say anything"" and he "" didn't talk like that"". i had not repeated what i had heard in my conversation with him, he then told me i was ""paranoid"". needless to say the barrington brewery is off our list, disrespect is intolerable. great barrington has a lot great options where you feel welcome and the food is awesome! sooooo, good bye to the brewery.",1.0,0
"I came for the love of their many ABSOLUTELY AMAZING beer, and now after three visits, I think I dont need to go back again.  I tried desperately to love this place, and still wish I could give a better review but the restaurant simply falls short.  To start, I hate seeing the same ""seafood special"" on the menu at every visit.  What is special about it if you serve it every day, or every week even.  The food would have decent value, if the kitchen can nail down an apparent issue with consistant product. It is never good to be surprised by the difference between two identical dishes.  The BBQ was just not good, I have no idea what techniques they use, but from someone who eats quite a bit of barbecue, the ribs seem to be cooked off in the oven, them are smothered in a rather ""unique"" sauce  which is super heavy with the consistency  and feel of a red tomato sauce. The appetizer, I think its called ""the plowmans lunch"" is EXACTLY what I like to see on a brewery resturant's menu, but the key here (as well as with all menu items) is to be FRESH and to manipulate the dish with the seasons. I am totally fine with paying a premium for apple slices, cheese, and bread, but bake the bread fresh,  and dont serve apples in the sping totally out of season.  I was very happy with the service  on my first visit when I was with just a coworker, but on the two occasions I attended with my wife and son, we were literally stuffed in a room with the other families without being offered an option, I get it, some kids are aweful dinners with aweful parents, just post it somewhere so we know ahead of time that we will recieve differant service if we bring our children. Damn, I really wanted to love this place, hopefully they can turn it around.",2.0,0

"This is one of the very first Mexican restaurants in the area, but we have seen many more pop up recently. Each town around here as at least 2 or 3. I think a lot of people come to this one because they are used to it, but if Xicohtencatl wants to keep up with their competition, they will have to up their game.Positives:* Ambience: the place is fun and colorful. Many tables outside and a good amount inside.* Menu: good variety of items on the menu* Price: reasonableNegatives* Our table sits 6, but was set for only 5. A person in my party had to ask for silverware 4 times, to the point that he still did not have it when his food arrived* Drinks: we were excited to sample some of the margaritas. They look good, but mine, the tropical one, was both very very weak and just bland in taste.* Food quality: out of 6 people, nobody really exulted in ""Oh this food is so good"". It was all pretty mediocre. I had a salad that was particularly bad, not just because it was lacking in flavor, but because they obviously washed the greens in water and did not drain it before serving it. So the leaves where floating in water. See photo.",4.0,1
"Xicohtencatl was a great stop for us, especially with two kids in tow.  Expect good food and great casual atmosphere with a lot of booths and alcoves.

"As huge fans of Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine, we chose Xicohtencatl for a get together with a friend. Xico is a step up from the usual taqueria, and while it's adapted for local tastes, it does a good job.  We ordered the Enchiladas de Chipilo (Enchiladas verdes) and the Mole Poblano Especial. The Enchiladas were tasty, well-prepared, and were a generous portion. The Mole was good, although I have to confess that we've traveled extensively thru Mexico, and although this was good, it lacked the deep spicing that one finds there.  The chicken was very well-seasoned, and again, the portion was huge. The waitstaff were attentive (maybe a bit too attentive?) but hospitable and friendly. In short, if you're looking for tasty Tex-Mex food in a nice setting with good service, Xico is an excellent choice.",5.0,1

"My  husband and I are from out of town and just happened upon this restaurant. Loved the atmosphere! The inside was very cutely decorated and the word that comes to mind for the outside seating is ""oasis"". It was fairly busy but we got seated right away. Initially we were seated right near the door with a lot of staff and patrons coming and going so we asked to move to a table tucked in the corner that was empty. Once we got moved, I think we got a little forgotten about. It took about 10 minutes to get water and put in a drink order. Once we were finished our meal, it seems like we sat for at least 15 minutes before getting the check as well.I had the tequila sunrise and my husband had a house margarita. Both tasted reasonably strong and were tasty! For dinner, I had the carnitas burrito. I consider myself a ""carnitas connoisseur"" and this burrito did not disappoint. My husband had the nachos appetizer as his meal and was also happy with it.If we are in the area again, I'd look forward to going back and trying a few other things off their menu!",1.0,0
"This review is really just for the subpar takeout experience. Since we had a big party we knew it would be hard to get a reservation. So I ordered online. Their website is easy to access and you just click the dishes you want and submit your name and phone number. They don't take your payment online, you pay when you pick it up. So far, so good. I placed the order and about five minutes later got an email saying to come pick it up in 15-25 minutes. That email was sent at 7:04 pm. I was surprised by how fast they said it would be and headed over immediately. When I got there they told me one dish I had ordered wasn't available but that the rest would be ready in 15-20 minutes. Ok, this too was fine. I had thought the original pick-up time seemed a bit too ambitious on their part and it was a nice evening so I was ok with waiting outside. 15-20 minutes later I check in and was told it would be another 10 minutes. Kept waiting... Everyone once in while the host would catch my eye and let me know they were still working on my order or at least acknowledge my presence. It was obvious they were very busy with all the tables both on the porch and inside the restaurant full. The waiters seemed a bit stressed and I noticed others who were also getting takeout had been waiting for awhile. I overheard the waitress telling one guy that they had messed up his order a little and were giving him a few dollars off. After about 40 minutes of waiting, the host came up and said I could pay, first telling me to double check the receipt and make sure all the dishes were correct. I asked him if that meant the food was ready and he said it was being packed up. He took my payment and then I continued to wait another 10 or so minutes. When the food finally came out it, he gave me a very heartfelt 'sorry for the wait'. I understand that things happen and that they might not be fully staffed up enough to deal with the new crowds now that covid restrictions are lifted, but proper planning and communication is key and they should have been up front and told me in the initial email that the food would take 45 minutes to an hour and I wouldn't have have waited around at their restaurant for a whole hour.  When I finally got my food in hand I checked my watch and it read 8:18pm. This was well over an hour from when I got the confirmation email from them saying the food would be ready in 15-25 minutes. All this waiting would likely have been acceptable if the food was amazing. But it wasn't good. It was only an 8 minute drive home from the restaurant so the dishes shouldn't have gotten cold so quickly. I'm guessing the food didn't all come out of the kitchen at the same time and some of it sat around for a while since some of it was cold. Sadly the nachos were very soggy (they should have put the guacamole, sour cream etc on the side to avoid this). The Mole Poblano chicken was very dry. The ceviche was passable, just sort of meh. The only dishes we really liked were the carnitas and the tinga quesadilla. I'm sure the food is normally good from this place since it's extremely popular, but they really need to work on their takeout procedures and be more realistic about how long the food will take to prepare. Telling someone every ten minutes that it will only be another ten minutes wait until an entire hour goes by is terrible customer service.",4.5,1
"I've had enough of this place! Each summer, I invite friends from out of state to The Berkshires and always include Xicoh on one of the nights. And each summer, they mess up my reservation, acting as if they're surprised at the arrival of 8 adults and they commence running around shoving tables together. This is despite my best efforts to book a table well in advance so we will be expected (and dare I hope, 'Welcomed'). This last visit was truly the LAST visit. In making the reservation, I got an email confirmation that simply said ""Your reservation is approved"" but didn't say the date or time - so as our trip got closer and I was finalizing itinerary for the week I had to call the restaurant and ask whether my reservation was for Sunday or Monday..they didn't have their book in front of them so told me to call back an hour later. I did so, and this time when I asked to confirm whether I had booked our group of 8 for Sun or Mon eve, a rude man told me ""do the math""...I asked him to repeat himself and this time he said ""Sunday."" When the actual dinner date arrived, once again the staff didn't say hello or welcome customers, nor were they prepared with a table.. but the final straw was when 2 of our 8 diners ordered the specialty, lamb shank, and both tried respectfully to eat it but finally they both gave up and said they couldn't choke it down due to the overwhelming amount of salt in the sauce poured on it! We told the waitress, who thanked us and said she would tell the chef. She then said the manager was going to give the 2 a serving of free rice, lol! We asked for the check and sure enough, they still charged full price for the inedible lamb shanks. I asked to have the manager come over and a guy with a silly man bun sulked over and begrudgingly said he'd take one of the lamb shanks off the bill. I did notice that when they brought the bill back, they had taken the cost of 1 lamb shank off and added $60 for the tip  Which was fine with me because the disgusting salty sauce wasn't the waitress' fault so if they'd have let me add my own tip amount, she would've gotten more money!In addition to hosting my own friends  in the Berkshires, I also rent out my home to short-term renters and I provide a list of suggested restaurants - TO BE SURE, XICOHTENCATL has been REMOVED from that list!",3.0,0
"We have driven past this restaurant SO many times & finally went. The food was great BUT it was so crowded. Good for them - but not so much for us. It was so loud. Also, So. Many. Kids. I have kids. I know what it's like. But mine are older & after what? 12 years of dealing with it ? Im just no longer into that vibe. The service was good, but not great. Mostly because of how crowded it was. I feel like if you have kids you should add another star. The food was good. And it's a good place for kids. Just not so much for ""grownups "" looking for a nice quiet dinner.",5.0,1

"The best part about this place is probably the chips and salsa, but if you ask for more your server will ignore you 4 times each time you ask for them and you will never get more. Bring bug spray if you eat outside as it was swarming with gnats and mosquitoes. The food for my group was mediocre as well as the drinks. For my meal personally, I ordered the sautéed corn appetizer and vegetarian nachos. I was given a plate of boiled corn and jumbo head on shrimp. When I said that I actually ordered the nachos the server said ""no you ordered this remember?"" Then I was given what I could only describe as microwaved nachos I would have made when I was home alone at age 10. The bathroom also had a urinal full of pee to top it all off. Go here if you like mediocre food with mediocre service",5.0,1

"Had an unplanned trip to Great Barrington and stopped here for a quick dinner bite.  Started with their calamari which was phenomenal.  Warm, buttery tender SAUTÉED (not breaded/fried) squid with the perfect amount of heat.  Yum!  Then the chicken mole crepes which were also terrific.  Chocolatey deep flavor, airy light crepes.  Date had the fish tacos which he demolished without even offering me a taste.  Had the picante mezcal cocktail that was muddled with cucumber and jalapeño - perfect!  Thank you for making our meal memorable!",5.0,1
"First off,  the restaurant has an amazing atmosphere. Yes,  they are extremely busy so keep that in mind.  Service was a little slow but, it's so worth the wait.  We started with guacamole and chips. This was quite possibly the best guacamole I've ever eaten.  The flavors were incredible. My date and I both ordered burritos. She got a steak burrito and  I ordered the Mexicano burrito. Both were so incredibly good but, I asked for a moment of silence to thoroughly enjoy mine.  There really aren't words to describe how good these were.  Kudos to the entire staff for their kindness. This was such a memorable experience we've already made plans to come back.",5.0,1

Everything was tasty and service was very sweet/efficient but not overbearing.",4.0,1
"My husband and I stopped by on our way up to Stockbridge. I immediately liked the cozy atmosphere and fun decor! We sat at the bar with a drink while waiting for our to go order. Husband got the quesadilla con tinga which he loved and I got tostadas de pueblo. It was a little plain for me but better when I added some habanero sauce. Since we didn't stay too long we didn't get the whole sit down experience, but the drinks were great, and the staff was really attentive despite a busy night for them. We will definitely visit again!",5.0,1
"I own a restaurant in a nearby town, and when it came time to choose a place for our staff party, the hands-down choice was Xico's. Many of us have been dining there for years, so we knew we could expect excellent food and drink, with many gluten-free options for those who needed them. The servers graciously handled taking and delivering orders to our (somewhat boisterous!) party -- and kudos to the kitchen, which managed to get all 18 entrees out nearly simultaneously (we know how hard it is to pull that off). Thank you for a delicious evening!",4.5,1
"Outside seating is plentiful, but could be it gets reserved.  When we arrived they hesitated to seat us outside, leading us to think perhaps tables were reserved.  This place gets packed, so get there early or make a reservation.  The portions are HUGE.  We had way too much food.  Locals probably know this.  But we didn't.  So order very conservatively.  Food was great.",1.0,0
"Management should be more in tune of what's going on in the restaurant.   Our server was soooo rude and disrespectful.  We waited 20 minutes for her to even say anything.  When she finally was ready to take our order she rolled her eyes and spoke to us in English when we clearly spoke Spanish,  her English we could not understand.  She also disrespected my senior mother when she asked her a question.  We had to ask to switch tables for someone who was very apologetic of the wait and poor behavior.  It's a shame we are here from NoVA and drove 7 hours to be treated so poorly our first night in the area.  The food mediocre.  We have been here a few years back and the mole was delicious.  Now not so much.  Watery with dry chicken breast's. ReallyDisappointing meal.",1.0,0
"Over priced food, and the menu is too much to be true. The mole was runny and not thick enough like other authentic moles. The Chile relleno wasn't battered and fried at all, it was stuffed with plain ingredients. It has nothing to do with authenticity.

"Passed by this place a couple of times at nights and seemed busy and thought we give it a try. Well we tried it and it was just ok. Everything was decent but nothing really special. The steak I ordered I wanted medium rare was more on the medium well side. I wanted the chicken quesadilla that I ordered for the kids however they brought me a kids size chicken quesadilla from the kids menu I guess. It was a bit on the smaller side and pretty simple. We also ordered the two combination steak and chicken fajitas, didn't come with to much and only two wraps. The beef was extra hard and chewy. Kids could not eat it for sure and even my wife and I had a hard time chewing it. Also for this I found the price to be really expensive. It was like $26 where I would normally have like at least 4 wraps and a lot more chicken and beef. My wife however did seem to like the rice and beans. The rice was soft and it wasn't bad. However this would not be a place I would come back to.",5.0,1

"We started coming to Great Barrington about two and half years ago and  we discovered  Xicoh early on and loved everything we tried. My wife and I are vegan and we had many options to  choose from, all incredibly tasty and the portions were generous and reasonably priced, at least for the area. We came back several times and had a similar experience. The last time we came however was not. Right from the start, the usually  creative cocktails were dull and lacked the same distinctive flavors. The experience with the food was similar. We think it was because it was the first time we were there on a summer weekend and they were packed and understaffed. We haven't given up yet, hence 4 stars, so we will be back to sample those wonderful flavors again.",5.0,1
"If I could award this place 6 stars I would. Originally stumbled across it one summer when my family and I were vacationing in the area.

I found myself in the area and again and just had to stop in. With it being winter the patio is closed so instead we got the pleasure of enjoying their traditional Mexican ambiance.

"Came here for dine in during COVID after several other places were booked up. Had a surprisingly great experience!A good amount of outdoor seating and everyone was wearing masks and gloves. Lots of hand sanitizer. And tables outside were also spread out well. Unfortunately their heating solution isn't great. They have massive flames, but for whatever reason don't provide much heat, and seem more liable to burn the building down than anything else. So dress warm! Big drink and food menu. I had some sort of margarita which was delicious and everyone else at the table loved their drinks too. We had the mushroom crepes for appetizer. I was a bit confused why they were serving crepes but they were great. Piping hot and nicely cooked mushrooms with a surprising kick on the inside. Had the special mole poblano with bone in chicken. Unclear why bone in chicken was more expensive by 6$ but whatever. It was excellent! Well cooked chicken and the sauce was just delicious. Came with extra rice and beans to mop up the extra sauce too. Also came out nice and hot. Service was quick, prices were pretty reasonable for the amount and quality of food you get. Not a hole in the wall or simple Mexican meal by any stretch if that's what you're looking for, but it was a great experience for us. Would definitely recommend them!",5.0,1

"Cocktails and a cozy atmosphere are what the X made passable, but cold entrees, skimpy chips, and bulky, clumsy crepas sank the ship.Our party of 10 were given two total complimentary baskets of chips and pico. I mention this because their policy is ""first basket free, subsequent at $4."" Fine, it's your house, but when the servings size is a kid's handful (seriously, there were maybe a dozen chips in each basket), you are shooting yourself in the foot. Good thing we were upsold two sizable molcajetes of fairly standard guac... for $30. Not the only gouge: the kid's quesadilla was one soft taco tortilla with a bit of cheese folded... for $6. Delicious cocktails (fan of the Kill Peel) still ran $12-15, and were served in ice-packed rocks tumblers. They disappeared in two crunches of a rare chip. Entrees were mediocre. My crepas con mole were way too thick, incredibly dense and only loosely ""stuffed"" with plain diced chicken. The resulting bites had bird falling out of their pancake pocket, which could have definitely used more of the flavorful mole.Another diner at our table got a lamb shank and it was refrigerator cold in the middle. Another friend was served the wrong drink, which was removed and almost immediately run to another guest. It just wasn't very good, and we left more than a bit bummed.",2.0,0

"Authentic Mexican food place with great atmosphere and staff. I actually came for my birthday with a small group of friends and everyone left satisfied. Two were vegetarian and I'm vegan, but the menu was great for all dietary needs. I ordered the ""Attack of the Wild Mushrooms "" ($18), which was sautéed fresh shiitake mushrooms and onions. It had great flavor, though I do wish it came with something else besides white rice. They don't have any birthday promos haha but it was still a fun experience. Other people in the group ordered Fajita Vegetables, a Burrito Eskitito, and some other  mole dishes that I forgot the names of.

It's very unique since it looks like a house and has bright colors.  The outside doesn't look like your standard restaurant.  When we first showed up, it was very crowded which is usually a good sign.  It looked like everyone was eating on someone's front porch, which gave me Bed And Breakfast vibes.  Our server was so sweet and checked in on us periodically to make sure that everything was good.  Then we got chips and salsa which is amazing.  I was a little worried the salsa would be spicy given that it was a Mexican restaurant.  Then we got the Enchiladas Verde and Tacos Pescado which were outstanding!  I was blown away with the quality of the food.  I expected it to be good, but not this good.  Sorry Bueno Y Sano, you just can't compare.  A bonus was that I even got to practice my Spanish.

Although they were busy, the service was prompt and attentive. We enjoyed everything about our experience and even had some leftovers for the taking.",2.0,0
Good service but the 4($10 Margaritas) were a little weak. Asked for a additional shot and was charged $12 more. That was more than the drink cost alone. Have been to many Mexican restaurants in the last 40 years but never paid $22 for a Margarita before. Stay far away from this place!,2.0,0

Service no better. Drinks - slow. Appetizers and mains came at once. Beans bland. How hard is lard? Please. If you can't do refried beans well, go home. Ordered guacamole (mine at home is better, and $16? At that price it better be good. It's not.) Chips were hours old. Fajitas for $25 came with 2 tortillas. And the guacamole on the side was brown. Corn dish which is $7 was canned corn sautéed with onions. Shame on you. The meat in the enchiladas was room temperature. Bacteria risk. I cannot encourage you to go elsewhere any more.  Oh, and 2 appetizers, 2 mains, 2 cocktails and 2 soft drinks: $110. What a rip off. Do tacos in your own kitchen first. Will never go back.",3.0,0
"There were 7 adults and 1 child and we were on vacation together to celebrate our grandson's 3rd birthday.  A couple of us had the bone in chicken mole.  The mole sauce was fresh, hot and it tasted great.  The chicken was defintely something from the refrigerator that was reheated and it wasn't even warm all the way to the bone. There was nothing else on the plate.  It came with a bowl of rice, which was good and tasted fresh.  A couple others had the enchiladas with the verde sauce.  They both said they liked it.  One person had the chicken dish with a creamy sauce that had poblanos in it.  It wasn't his favorite.  The guacamole was terrific, but the chips were a little stale and not enough for the table sized guac.  The service was very acceptable and the drinks were a 10!  I had the fresh strawberry mojito while the others had marguerites.We picked this restaurant because it could accommodate a vegetarian diner and had outdoor seating.

"Truly terrible experience here with a party of six, including four octogenarians. The restaurant is clearly accepting too many reservations and is overwhelmed. It took about two hours to get our food and when it finally came it was really bland and poorly made. The mushroom tacos had very little flavor and the portion was small. The rice and beans were also flavorless and seemed like they'd been sitting around a long time.

"This is an appealing but ultimately disappointing restaurant.  The menu is great and ingredients are fresh with some good preparation, but the missteps make me wonder if  enough of the kitchen staff are familiar with Mexican food preparation.  The chile relleno was pretty good, and the pineapple agua fresca was lovely.  Rice and beans for dinner were fine but a bit underseasoned-- could use more cumin and garlic.  Enchiladas were very disappointing-- raw tasting, hard tortillas and the salsa verde was too thin and also undercooked for this kind of preparation.  Feta cheese absolutely did not belong and ruined the flavor.  I appreciate that there are vegetarian dishes, but they're all done with mixed, grilled vegetables, which not everyone wants.  It would be good to have some dishes with spinach and mushrooms or beans and cheese as fillings.  Also I wish there was a bit more heat in all the dishes.  I know it's the Berkshires, but a little serrano or jalapeno would boost the flavor of these dishes.",5.0,1

"Saturday evening out and was very much looking forward to our meal at Xicotencatl to start the evening. First, Male Waiter we had was rude, made a comment to my wife that was totally inappropriate after she questioned him about an ingredient. I let him know it was uncalled for. We could see him communicating the issue to a younger female waitress and peering at us laughing. It's very easy to tell when you're being talked about, and laughed at, and both of us are bilingual so we did understand the comments. The waiter came back with our appetizer, set it down and walked away, nothing was said to us, no smile or anything. As we started eating we could see the two watching us from the bar area and laughing, whispering to each other. This was very uncomfortable, and made us feel like our food was tampered with. Our meals came out, again nothing was said, and again, we were being observed by these two , still laughing. The food was not what it should have been , as we've had this dish before. There was some kind of hot sauce poured over it that didn't belong. Couldn't finish it and afraid to send it back for fear of retaliation but we think our meal was already tampered with by one of these two servers. Never again!

"I do not come here often - and I have been known to openly regret this to my friends in the area when I lament our area's need for another option to go out to eat - especially at lunch time where it seems no one in the sleepy little Southwest corner of Massachusetts has the interest (or the staffing) to open for a weekday lunch. However, went with 5 friends and co-workers today...Will likely be another long spell before my next visit. The food here is very good. Albeit over priced to accommodate the interests of out-of-towners who flood our community in the winter (skiing), fall (leaf peeping), and summer (lakes). For the quality guac and interesting drink menu, you get two stars as one would have to drive an hour(s) to get similar around here. Today, however, we arrived exactly at opening. Sat on the lovely patio - and for the first 30min of our experience had NO ONE ELSE in the restaurant to compete with. With that said, and even despite our good moods on a beautiful summer day, I would say our level of service was, at the very least, embarrassing. 30min to receive drinks (we were the ONLY customers), incorrect drinks arrived (we were the ONLY customers), and an indignant waitress at the end who assured me ""I would be paying for the drinks because (get this) we TASTED IT!!""6 Lunch entrees took 60min to arrive - oh, and you guessed it - one was incorrect (we were the ONLY customers). Rather than send it back, and risk another hour wait, we made due. Maybe they have us right where they want us due to no competition. Maybe they know their guac and chips are simply outstanding. Maybe... but maybe I'll find someplace else to go to lunch when I don't have 3hrs to kill.",2.0,0
"5 Stars For The Beautiful Porch, 2 Stars For Boring FoodWhat a pretty pretty place - really a beautiful setting seated outside on the porch as the sun was setting. Really strong pina colada was good, and the menu sounded great. However, the food was boring at best. I had a side of guacamole, needed salt, or some lime juice, or cilantro, or jalapeno, in short, it was really bland. Chips were nothing special either.I had the 3 assorted enchiladas, the green sauce I could barely taste, the mole had a horrible burned bitterness and was watery, and the red sauce tasted like Taco Bell.Sorry, I had expected much more than what I got, and it's NOT cheap either.",5.0,1
"I was mostly impressed by the orange/yellow/pink color scheme (who knew?? -- I am desperately trying to imagine where I can use this in my own house --- can't, but I'm still thinking about it!!), the strong margarita, the spicy chili pepper used in the chili relleno, and the best refried beans I think I've ever had.  The rest of the food was unremarkable. The server, while pleasant AND sassy, seemed overwhelmed by too many tables as the place filled up on a summer weekend.The paint scheme though !!!",2.0,0
The food and the service were superb! They were very accommodating to my allergy to black pepper. The tomatillo sauce was perfect! Fresh flavorful food and great service. What could be better?Went back six months later and the food was truly awful! Watery mole! Slow service and reheated food. Don't go there in the spring or off season!,5.0,1

"Your absolutely need a reservation here, even in the middle of winter. It is not because people come from Mike's to taste authentic cuisine. Basically, it is the only decent Mexican style restaurant South of Williamstown that is not a burrito joint. (BTW, the burrito place is decent.)You will find really good New England Sytle Mexican food here, but not excellent. Don't come here for authentic Southwest or Mexican meal. But, what you do get is tasty and fresh.I had a really good salmon and mushrooms over lettuce and rice. It was tender and flavorful. And, the rice was outstanding. My wife had the mole, which is a signature dish here. She described it as decent. Of course, it tasted even better with the sangria.A guest had some great looking carnitas.i can't speak for the flavor, but he ate every bite. I will be coming back.",1.0,0
"Don't bother!  First and last time here.  We were out for a drive and looked up Mexican Restaurants in area to try.  We ordered the nachos as an appetizer which were just ok, (on the small side).  I ordered the carnitas burrito and my significant other ordered the chicken burrito.  They were Luke warm at best and nothing memorable.  Rice inside was mushy, not much on beans and sauce that came with it on the side taste greasy and not much on flavor.  The nachos put on table when we first sat down was tiny and not given with salsa but pico de Gallo which was odd and tomatoes were in strips making it hard to pick up with the chips.  We are from NYS and have been to many Mexican Restaurants in many different locations and this place, though looked quaint, did not deliver on taste/presentation.  Their frozen strawberry margarita was good.",4.0,1

The tacos al pastor were delicious and topped with a tasty grilled pineapple salsa.  The tacos bistek were equally as good and were topped with a salsa verde that was fresh and herbaceous.  The staff was friendly and helpful. The interior was warm and inviting. I will be back soon.",1.0,0
Food is bland and overcooked. I tried the mole special. Worst mole I've ever had. It's suppose to be their house special. Chicken was bone dry. My wife got the beef fajita. Bland and beef overcooked.

"We had dinner reservations tonight at 5:30 for 9 people(4 adults and 5 children). We were seated at 5:30 and our food arrived at 6:40. Three orders of fajitas were delivered. They were burned on the bottom so only about half of the order could be eaten. What was eaten was overdone and tough. We thought about returning the burned meal, but decided not to since our original wait was over an hour.We live in Stockbridge. My daughters family along with us selected this restaurant several times for takeout during the quarantine. This was our 1st time back to the restaurant in person. Very disappointing.",5.0,1

"The reviews seem to either love this place or hate it.  Put us firmly in the love category, can't really figure out the rest.  We routinely sample Mexican in NYC and many other places.  Xicohtencatl can keep up with all of them.  The margaritas are great - no agave syrup, just lime juice, tequila, and various orange liqueurs.  The guacamole was super fresh - the menu says made to order, and that was obvious.  I'd probably have preferred a little more spicy for the guacamole, but they do allow you to customize - we didn't because it was our first time here.  I had the chicken with the chef's special mole sauce - it was truly fantastic and would stand up to any dish at any authentic Mexican restaurant we have tried.  It's a simple dish - just the mole and thin pounded chicken breast, with rice on the side, but extremely well done.  My wife (a vegetarian) had the Attack of the Wild Mushrooms, which was unexpectedly spicy and loved it.  Outdoor seating was spacious, warm (heaters) and covered.  All in all, a real surprise and delight.",4.5,1
Vegetarian options are really bad. Wish there was just a plain burrito without meat instead of having the only option be a soggy vegetable burrito.,4.0,1
"Definitely a more ""authentic"" style Mexican restaurant than your typical Americanized versions. We had the lunch menuband enjoyed an order of Guacamole made from scratch. The ""Burro Mexicano"" was an oversized burrito with steak, chicken, rice, beans, and grilled vegetables. I asked for the house habanero sauce on the side- BE CAREFUL! Topped the meal off with the Flan with Kahlua... creamy and delicious. Will try the dinner menu next time. Worth a stop if you're in the Great Barrington area.",3.0,0
"we had lunch here yesterday and the food was good, but the service poor.  they sat is quickly and brought salsa, chips and water quickly and that is where it ended.  it took 20 minutes for someone to take our order.  they brought the wrong bottle of wine - already opened.  by the time the brought the right one (again already opened) our entrees arrived - it all arrived at once.  we weren't the only ones frustrated by the service - they were understaffed for the lunch rush.  the decor is fun and festive and they have nice outdoor seating.  i want to like it but my wife says it's not a do again",1.0,0
"This place has ok Mexican food- nothing really special. But, like so many restaurants in the Berkshires, it has absolutely horrible service. I expect to wait for a table even with a reservation, but not 35 minutes. Then, we get seated across the driveway in the grass where the mosquitoes are rampant, nobody brings water, or chips, and more importantly, nobody explains that they are short staffed and it's going to be a long drawn out affair ordering and getting served. Nobody seems to care. We committed an hour in total then left. Good restaurants comp their customers if service is bad due to staffing- a free drink or offer of dessert, or something. They have no business fully booking their tables if they don't have adequate staff. Like I initially said, the food here isn't all that good. I won't go back.",3.0,0
"This casual place used to be my favorite restaurant but I notice it's gone downhill. For starters, our chips were stale and the serving of guacamole, although tasty, was small for the $15 charge.Next we had an appetizer corn dish, Esquites. Very disappointing as at the height of the local corn season, it was made with frozen corn . We ordered Molcajete which was previously so delicious and found the chicken was skimpy and not nearly as special as it used to be.Expensive place overall for small portions.",5.0,1

They have fruit infused water for the non-alcoholics.  The mole is from scratch by a chef. If you think Chipotle's & Taco Bell is Mexican ""food"" then you don't deserve to eat here.

"Delicious authentic Mexican food. Edel was a tremendous waiter and even gave my daughter a serving of the chocolate that the chef uses to make the churros. They were packed when we went on a Tuesday night 7p. Once the margaritas came, life was great.

"This is a nice little restaurant. It seems to lack a lot of the mexican food that I'm used to, such as lengua and tripa, but it does have a decent selection. The tacos are quite lovely, and are filled with generous portions of meat, guac, etc... They have mole sauce, which is generally tough to find the US. The also have a good selection of tequilas, both straight, and in mixed drinks. The vegetarian selection is quite impressive for a Mexican restaurant, and the menu seems to contain high quality ingredients. The price is a bit on the higher side, but that's what happens when higher quality ingredients are involved.",5.0,1

"We LOVE Mexican food.  Over the past 30 years we have been to Mexican restaurants throughout the US and in Mexico.  This restaurant wins the prize as the ABSOLUTE WORST Mexican Restaurant that we have been to.   I ordered the Chicken Fajitas.  The low quality chicken (not white meat) seemed to be previously cooked chicken that was reheated.  Fajitas should be brought to the table sizzling on sizzling platters.  NOT AT THIS RESTAURANT!  The platter was correct type but it was not hot.  The food on the platter was lukewarm at best.  Plus, there was so much grease on the food and platter that I leaned it to one side by putting my napkin under it in order to puddle the grease to one side of the platter.   There was so much grease that it was measurable and covered about 1/2 the platter when puddled.  Also, this restaurant uses an odd spice on the chicken that tasted like barbecue sauce.  (Not Mexican) My husband got a Beef Burrito.  He told me the Burrito was not very hot and had little flavor.  Also, it was lacking the traditional Mexican sauce that comes with a burrito.  If we had not just arrived in the Berkshires after a long ride, we would have complained about the food and gone elsewhere.  Unfortunately, we were new to the area and tired so we ate this junk.  We sat outside because of Covid.  The waiter came to our table with his mask  wrapped around his neck!  We wondered if he cared that many people eating outside were probably sitting outside to limit exposure to Covid. Save your money.  Don't go to this place.  Based on our experience there, we believe that they do not care about the food quality or the customers.",1.0,0
"I went here with my significant other the day before the 4th for lunch.  The hours are 12-9pm online and I figured with no sign stating different this would be the same.  It was around 2:30pm,  There were plenty of people on the patio and in the drive way outside.  We went in and were seated by a friendly server, so far so good.  That's where the service ended.  A waitress came to take our drink order and then nothing, about 15 minutes later another gentlemen comes to ""take our drink order"" when we tell him someone else took it and we are ready to order food he just says ""oh"" and walks a way, waitress then comes and takes our order.  Another 15 minutes later our waitress comes out and tells us the kitchen is closed, but she will try and get us food.  Behind her another waitress is telling another couple that the restaurant is disorganized and that the staff has no idea what's happening with back office.  Well. . . we get our food, the guacamole is good, but the tacos don't have any of the promised ingredients just the steak, lettuce, and tomatoes.  I could have done a better job myself.  I will not go back and do not recommend for the money.   Drive to Chatham, NY if you want decent Mexican.",4.0,1
"My husband and I stopped here upon arriving into Great Barrington.  This restaurant had a beautiful porch with tons of outside seating.  We sat outside, since it was so nice out.  We ordered some margaritas, which were good.  We ordered the nachos as an appetizer, which could have been better, not the best nachos in the world.  For entrees my husband got the chicken mole which he said was delicious and I got the spinach chile rellenos, which were really tasty too.  This place was pretty pricey for a Mexican restaurant.  Overall the food was good, but overpriced.  The waiter that we had was attentive, but could have been a little friendlier.",4.5,1
"Wow... beyond terrible. Food - started with the ceviche... did not taste fresh. Main course chicken mole, described as the house special...left most of a ridiculous small portion behind as it was inedible... only seasoning you could taste was salt and lots of it. Service - was horrible...inattentive, had to ask for chips, brought appetizer and main course at once minus the sides, had to ask multiple times for the check.Drinks - the only bright spot...strong and well made. My recommendation - would never ever go there to eat again. Worth stopping by for a quick drink and that would be all...!",5.0,1

"Recommended to us as a vegan/vegetarian friendly place, we were excited to see all the vegetarian dishes that supposedly come with jalapeño rice and beans. Instead, we got white rice and no beans without a warning. Ordered guacamole and never received it. Upon receiving our disappointing, bland dinners, we requested to still have the guacamole and requested hot sauce- the reply was the only sauce they have is VERY spicy - sounds great. We ate slow, waiting for it, and received it after asking a second time - then were charged for it. The sauce AND guacamole were taken from our table before it was finished. Everyone has an off day, but this was pitiful. Would never return, which is too bad because the place is adorable and other dishes did look nice.",4.0,1
"Came here on an intensely cold and rainy day recently for a midweek early dinner and weren't quite sure what to expect given that this was our first time here and we were the only customers. However, we were seated right away in what is arguably the cutest little alcove with booths that look out across the porch and parking lot...and to our surprise, there soon began a constant stream of customers coming in after us. Turns out that nasty weather can't keep people away from this gem.The pros:- Service is fast and friendly.- Menu is creative and offers more than just the run of the mill burrito/enchilada/fajita situation.- As a vegetarian, I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of meatless dishes.- Authentic guacamole is pricey, but an absolute must. Since it's made to order, make sure to tell them exactly how you like it (e.g., extra spicy, garlicky, salty, heavy on the cilantro, etc.)- Traditional cocktails like mojitos and margaritas are handcrafted with fresh ingredients. Pro tip: if you're into Mezcal like me, ask them to make you a margarita with it and let your mind be blown!The cons:- Pricey. No two ways to slice it. Expect to pay more than you think you will need to. The food and drinks are definitely delicious and fresh, but questionable weather they warrant the price tags they come with.- There's only 1 bathroom per sex. This was not a problem when the restaurant wasn't full, but even with 20 or so patrons when we were there, a line started to form.",3.0,0

We had three people and it was $84 with tip.We ordered and assortment of food and I got a margarita which was yummy, but nothing really stood out for me.

The décor was definitely Mexcian inspired, but the seating was very cramped and the torn paper decorations on the ceiling need to be replaced.The server was very friendly and she was very happy to answer questions and help us pronounce the restaurant's name.

"Friendly waitstaff, pretty good Mexican food, although it's relatively inconsistent. Pricey for what it is, but as I've stated in other reviews, that isn't uncommon for Great Barrington/southern Berkshires.The tres leches cake is delicious as is the mango cheese cake. Be forewarned, they will charge you for hot sauce. Good tequila selection, and nice aguas frescas. The atmosphere is nice and well decorated. Outdoor seating is nice in the summer.4 stars for service and ambiance, 3 for food because sometimes it is great and sometimes it is mediocre.",4.5,1
"I guess I got a bad night at this place. They seemed totally overwhelmed by the post-COVID Saturday night crush. After a reservations debacle and an eternal wait for a server, we placed our order for drinks, appetizers and entrees. After another totally unacceptable eternal wait, the server (apologizing profusely and blaming the kitchen) brought all of our food at once. Cold nachos, cold enchiladas and cold fajitas (with the wrong tortillas). I think the food would have tasted good, but it certainly didn't taste good cold. My recommendation - check this place out on a slow weekday.",3.0,0
"I thought that I was going to like this restaurant but I actually found the food disappointing. I think that it was too much like ""Mexican home cooking"" for all of us. The Carnitas (pork with rice) were not tasty at all, had too much fat, there was too much rice and even the guacamole was lacking flavor.  The Burrito Grandes was no better, it was huge but it was filled with rice and beans -- the chicken was tough to find. Even the salsa, that was served with chips, lacked any flavor at all.  The Chile Rellenos were pretty good though.I should have asked for hot sauce -- it would probably have helped all the dishes.",5.0,1

"The service here is mediocre, and certainly depends on the night. I've had fantastic service(Michelle, Katie) and I have had someone throw a check at me and lie about them closing so he could close out. The food is good, but the portions rarely justify the price. I will tell you that the drinks never fail to be awesome. Tonight, I made a reservation for 7 so our table was ready when we got there. They had our table set with chips and salsa at each end. The baskets were empty. I counted the chips(because I'm crazy) in the bigger basket and there were 14. I posted a picture because I thought it was so pitiful. Thinking a mistake was made, I asked the server and she informed me that that's how they serve it now. How expensive is a basket of chips? Two of us asked for sour cream and they charged us extra for a 2 ounce side. There were more issues(issues with basic food requests), but I shouldn't ramble on. I've had bad experiences here, but tonight takes the cake. They have lost our whole table. *Edit* the server just spilled my new drink on me.",4.0,1

"So I'm judging this based upon a take out order. Staff was friendly and the order was ready when they said it would be.  Restaurant was pretty full and busy.  Smelled good when I walked in.My order was just kind of average.  I was hoping for something above the average Mexican restaurant meal.  I ordered the Eskipito (beef version) burrito from the Burritos Grandes part of the menu.   It was certainly grande.  In fact, grande enough for two people. :)  However, it was mostly rice and hardly any beef.  :/So nice place, nice people and atmosphere which is what you typically look for in a Mexican restaurant.  That and a few margaritas and some laughs.  Maybe I'll try a different dish next time, and a margarita. :)",3.0,0
Nice outdoor seating. Great menu but not a lot of flavor in the food.  Kids meals were puny and boring. Seven year old looked at her food and asked for sour cream $1 extra on top of the $6 meal. Margaritas were good- but it's hard to mess those up!  Overall a pleasant place with OK food. We would go back- but not in a hurry. Extra charges for chips - even there wasn't enough for the nachos and a party of six. Bring your own hot sauce!,4.5,1
"Mediocre, expensive, slow service. That about sums it up. Tacky atmosphere, really not a good place at all. There are not many good restaurants in the area (or at least we couldn't find any) so we went back a few times. Always just so-so and really high priced. Always about $80 for two people and we don't even get an appetizer. Would not return.",3.0,0
"I was hoping for a better choice with vegan offerings, but most vegan meals just involve holding the cheese, crema, sour cream, or whatever else makes it tasty.

If they ever do this, then it will be 5 stars.",2.0,0

Great customer service. I'll tell you your food was sub par. I won't ask for anything for free. I felt robbed by this place tonight for the amount of money I paid.

"Some things get better with age. Good wine, good writers and good chefs. We learned this lesson again when we went this Mexican restaurant favorite in great barrington. We had not been here to almost a year. We had avoided the crowds and the long wait without the reservation. We picked a Sunday night each had no crowd or waiting time. Our memory of wonderful sophisticated Mexican appetizers and unique entrees mixed with traditional preparations, and an outstanding Tequila selection were recalled. The services, the food menu and drink list, the flavors were memorable again. One of the truly memorable moments came as we were taken to our table on the front porch of this west facing building. We ordered our drinks and relaxed into the sunset before ordering our dinner. So we are remembering and updating our visit to this gem of a restaurant which gets better with time. Go back for another visit or go there for the first time. It's worth the wait. You can't hurry an outstanding dining experience or a sunset.",5.0,1

"Stopped for Cinco de Mayo lunch. We ordered a $10 nachos appetizer and were in disbelief how small the bowl was when it was brought to our table. It was tasty but there simply were not enough chips. We asked for more chips due to the fact we had half the bowl full of toppings and the basket of chips given to us were the perfect amount to finish it. I was shocked when I was charged for the extra chips. Thank goodness my son didn't follow my suggestion to ask for another tortilla for his fajitas; they only gave him one! I was in disbelief the ""manager"" would not take off the added chip charge from my $79 bill. They lost a potential customer and I will spread the word.",1.0,0
"It's not fair to point fingers and put all the blame on one person or thing, but I get the picture... they invested a lot into the decor and feel of the restaurant and I believe they are compensating by SKIMPING OUT ON THE FOOD (Quality + portions), over charging on all the dishes and extras. Where's the rest of the chips? The guacamole was disguised with green bell peppers. That is unheard of! Quite an original way of stuffing the bowl. Good for: margaritas ($8-13 each) and guacamole ($13). It'd be different if they charged you for chip refills if they first give you enough to finish your guacamole. The service was dodgy, but that isn't to say that they were rude, they were just really busy which is understandable-but we waited 15 minutes to get water. Had to give the snapper a funeral because it was fishy and not fresh. My fajitas came with only 2 tortillas and 4 pieces of shrimp. The grand total for 2 people came out to $75... enough said? Park at your own risk, very small parking lot, space is limited, dirt lot.",5.0,1
"We've been to Xicohtenxatl now 4-5 times this summer - excellent every time! The margaritas are hand-made deviousness; the fresh guacamole is absolutely worth it; the enchiladas (all of them) are wonderful; their rendition of ribs, superb. Service has been excellent ever time we've gone. With this level of consistency and effort - especially during challenging times - is worthy of a 5 star review. We highly recommend!",5.0,1
"I was brought back to my January vacation to Mexico just by stepping into this restaurant. It's like a vacation!We were seated on the porch, which was perfect in the leftover evening heat (90 degree day, UGH). We ordered a carafe of Mango agua fresca, which I definitely suggest you order. It was so refreshing and delicious. As flavorful as mango juice, but not as sugary sweet. We then decided to share the tilapia tacos, flautas de pollo, and the nachos. The tacos were delicious, with a green and red sauce, radishes, fried fish, avocado, and onions. The flautas were very good, so crispy! I really loved them. The nachos were good, but as soon as they weren't hot, not as good. Could have used some more chips. The toppings on them are very delicious!The staff was super friendly and accommodating. They had great recommendations. I can't wait to go back.",5.0,1

No fault of the restaurant but bring bug spray.",4.5,1

"The restaurant seems great from the outside. Nice outdoor seating. My family of 2 kids, 2 parents and a baby arrived at 7:30 on a Monday night in the summer. The hostess asked me if I preferred indoor or outdoor seating. I said outdoor seating. Get this - she then said, ""well we only have one table outside - can I seat you inside?"" Um, why ask me which I prefer if there was no outdoor seating for us?I said yes to being seated inside because I figured the one outdoor table was too small for us. Not so! The party RIGHT BEHIND US which was the same size got seated outside. And the large party after them! I know it seems like a small thing but it was a beautiful summer night and it just seemed odd. The food was okay - not great -  too oily and over salted. We waited a LONG time before anyone came to our table. To give credit where it is due, our young waiter was very nice and sweet to the kids.

"I usually enjoy this spot, but tonight was definitely not up to the standards I've had for the place. The chips and salsa portion was weak and we were a party of 7.  My friend ordered a chicken and cheese quesadilla and it came without chicken and was two tiny pieces (think kid portion).  She and another friend ordered sour cream and were charged for the small side. Midway through the meal, the waitress spilled a drink on a friend of mine. I thought I ordered my usual enchilada entree but must not have because it came in a crazy spicy sauce which I couldn't eat. I realize this was 100% my fault as I clearly ordered the wrong dish, and they did fix it for me, but not worth the $18 price tag. Drinks were great as was sitting outside on the porch but I'm very sad that I had to change my previous raving review.",5.0,1
"Fresh local Mexican food! I got the chicken enchiladas and my husband got the Tilapia burrito and a house margarita. We were not disappointed in the slightest.

Service is slow and not good quality. The diet Coke is water down terribly. The burrito is filled full of rice with a little bit of meat. My wife ordered a fajita and they only gave her one tortilla tortilla. We ordered a side order of chips and salsa that was about the half of an order for one person. The quality of the food is good but the rest of it is not so good,5.0,1
Had a great lunch (dinner) today.  On the porch with the sun shining. Meal was started with their fresh guacamole and a Negra Modelo. Then came the two Burritos.  Fantastic. Couldn't possibly finish the meal but every bite was perfect!   Nothing could make this experience more perfect.  Waitress was wonderful!!,5.0,1
This was a great find!   We stopped here for lunch on a beautiful day.  Sat outside and enjoyed the view.  Waitress was very good. We ordered a couple appetizers and their fresh Guacamole. It was possibly the best I've had.  It's a great spot to stop at.,4.0,1
"I have been here many times and have never had a bad experience. I usually come for lunch as the lunch menu is great and reasonably priced. The food always tastes fresh and I have not had bad service yet. It usually isn't overly crowded during lunch, so I cannot say how it is during the dinner rush. The agua frescas are delicious and very refreshing. The margaritas are fantastic too. They might be the best margaritas I have had in the Berkshires. I have tried several different items on the lunch menu including the avocado salad, burrito, and enchiladas. All delicious and I have no complaints.",4.5,1

It was baked and came with queso melted on top.  My friend ordered the nachos and liked them, but they were nothing to write home about.  My other friend ordered Chiles Rellenos de Espinaca and said they were great but the waiter had forgotten the rice and beans side dish which took away some of the enjoyment.For such a small town out in the ""country"" we were pleasantly surprised and vastly enjoyed our meal.  the restaurant itself has a great ambiance and a very lovely wrap-around porch diners can sit on.",3.0,0

The sun was shining and I sipped on a tasty margarita (they have several on the menu) and the hot sun was going down over the hills.  The service was slow but they were dealing with a big crowd, since the place has a lot of outdoor seating.  Everything we ordered hit the spot: the burrito was fresh, the grilled meat was tasty, chips and salsa were fine.  Well, the salsa was a pico de gallo, I would have preferred a more liquid dip.  We were very happy overall.",3.0,0

"Came here for lunch!  The pros: amazingly tasty and fresh guacamole and chips! Wonderful friendly service!The cons: the food was fine but not amazing! I was a bit taken aback by my fajita order as I have always gotten fajitas meat brought out still sizzling in a frying pan.  In this case it was more of a fajita platter with meat brought out on a plate alongside the rice, beans, guacamole and sour cream. It came with one large tortilla on the side which was kind of weird.. Would have preferred numerous smaller tortillas.They had an extensive and impressive drink list but unfortunately the strawberry margarita I had was not very good.  That being said, everyone else's margaritas were very good from what they said.",2.0,0
"beggars can't really be choosers, so let me preface by saying i wasn't expecting to be transported to mexico when i ate here. now that i got off that my chest, i gotta say the meal started out strong with some solid guac and margs. mains were pretty lack-luster. what sealed the deal for the crappy rating were two factors: service wasn't too hot and the place was pretty dead AND something really crazy was going down in the women's restroom which my fiesta and i were conveniently seated front row for soo ay dios mio",5.0,1

"I got the chicken mole and.... YUM, that was delicious. The sauce was just amazing. I had it with the bone-in chicken which was just fabulous. I would absolutely get it again. The shrimp dish my aunt had also looked great... this is a place to get the entree rather than a fajita or more ""normal"" Mexican dish.

"In a time when too many people think of Mexican food as something associated with a talking chihuahua, Xicoh is a gem.  While not a particular fan of Mole, theirs is award winning.  The FINE selection of tequilas (and Margaritas) is impressive.  And the menu selection is wide and varied.  Over the years the SIZE of the portions, especially of their delicious guacamole appetizer, has shrunk some.  And I am NOT a fan of the charge for additional tortilla chips (worth it, anyway) to accompany their delicious homemade salsa.  The staff is cheerful and attentive.  The decor is tasteful and authentic.  Only the acoustics of the room can be a bit loud on crowded nights.  All in all, a delicious Mexican dining experience.",2.0,0

"so disappointing to see their prices have been raised too high and their portions sizes are smaller. Been a patron for years and enjoyed the moderate pricing and ample portions. Now, they seem to have  outpriced themselves, offer 5 free tortilla chops with a dollop of salsa and when we asked for me more they informed me that there would be a $1 charge! Their portion size for their above average Mexican fare has simultaneously been reduced.Won't return until they get a reality check and bring their good pricing back and generously serve tortilla chips and salsa on the house !Very sad to see this casual Mexican restaurant think they can get away with this! They just lost a long time fan!",4.0,1
"We made a reservation and it was a good thing, it was soo crowded. We were sat right away and the service was quick. Our food actually took under 10 minutes from when we ordered, the guacamole was out immediately (not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing...).I had the vegetarian enchiladas and they were good, I really enjoyed the salsa verde. Overall I liked the place and the only reason I can't give five stars is because there was no salsa. It was more of a pico de gallo and I was sad, chips and salsa is one of my favorite parts about Mexican restaurants. Oh well.",4.0,1
"Holy guacamole, this place is great! Don't ask me how to pronounce the restaurant name, but I was very impressed with the food here. Everything we tried was fresh and delicious and not at all greasy.Chips and salsa were brought to the table as soon as we were seated, and they were replenished as needed. Drinks and appetizers came next. I highly recommend you try some of their margaritas, particularly the blue raspberry and prickly pear, both of which were strong but also refreshing and delicious. We had the fried calamari, quesadillas, and something called Tostadas de Pueblo for appetizers. The former two were forgettable, but the latter was the best part of the meal. It consisted of two tortillas piled high with refried beans, lettuce, onions, chicken, salsa, and sour cream. That's like a whole bunch of my favorite things all in one!I got an order of chicken tacos for my entree. They were good, but the best part was definitely the housemade tortillas. I could eat them entirely plain and still be perfectly content, they were just that good. For dessert, we tried the fried ice cream and mango cheesecake. Both were pretty good. It's hard to impress me when it comes to cheesecake (Nothing can beat what my mom makes), but the crust on Xicohtencatl's version was phenomenal. And the mango chunks were plentiful too. One of my favorite things about Xicohtencatl (boy, that's a fun word to type) is that they don't skimp on anything. Portion sizes were generous. And I didn't have to hunt for any of the ingredients listed on the menu. if they said the tacos came with chopped onions, they didn't mean one or two pieces that you have to use a magnifying glass to find.  The menu said onions, and I got onions! I asked for sour cream on my tacos, and they didn't give me half a teaspoon's worth. I said sour cream, and they gave me plenty! This was a welcome change of pace compared to many other restaurants I've been to recently.I will definitely be back next time I'm in the area. There's a whole lot on the menu that I'd still like to try.",4.0,1
Do yourself a favor and try the adobo lamb shank. My girlfriend ordered it and it was amazing!!!  I finished it for her. I had the mole poblano chicken which was good but nothing like that lamb shank!  Tasty margaritas!  Very accommodating for gluten allergies!,5.0,1
"Went on a cold Monday night and it hit the spot! Some friends and I were staying in the Berkshires and decided to go out on a Monday nigh for dinner. Almost everything was closed aside from Xicohtencatl. Our server was really friendly and laid back, he suggested we started off with the fresh Guacamole, so glad he did, because it was served traditionally in a Molcajete and SO delicious. We also had the Pozole, which was perfect. For our Entrees we had Tacos al Pastor, which was Lean pork marinated and grilled in the Pastor style wrapped in a flour tortilla with pineapple salsa and chipotle sauce - Spicy and sweet, pork was tender,  Amazing Mole Poblano, traditional mole, a delicious alchemy of almonds, chocolate, and six chilies, served over boneless breast of organic chicken - this was so rich and full of flavor, we ate every last drop of this sauce with rice Enchiladas Especial,  Two enchiladas chipilo, chicken with salsa verde with actual creme fresh and cheese - This was also perfect and reminded my friend of how he ate these back home Snapper Steak with Guajillo Cream Sauce, Filet of Red Snapper broiled to perfection and topped, with a unique guajillo chile cream sauce, served with the best mexican rice you've ever tasted and sautéed spinach - This was divine, the fish was cooked perfectly, the creme sauce brought out the intensity of the guajillo pepper nicely while also keeping the heat tame, Favorite dish for sure.  Being a chef, I am always so fascinated with what Mexican chefs do with their chile peppers, not to mention sauces as well!",4.5,1
"Yes, it's good. This authentic Mexican restaurant has very good food and is run by a well intentioned family.  While the wait may be long, and, at times, the service disjointed, you will not be disappointed with the chef's recipes and preparation. Most particularly, the mole is solid, and reflects a regional taste that, while not suited to everyone's taste, this diner mopped it up with a tortilla until the plate was clean.  Cocktails, made with fresh ingredients, are tasty and worth the few extra bucks.  My fellow diners were all pleased with their plates. We will be back.",1.0,0
"Pricey, so-so food, slow service. Speaking to the manager revealed the source of the mediocre service; she was unfriendly and interrupted us while talking to answer a phone call.Delicious margaritas, as others have stated, but far too expensive!

"We liked our food. The menu had plenty to choose from other than the typical tacos or burritos that you'd find at most Mexican places. The rice and beans were very good and the enchilladas had very good flavor and the perfect amount of spice. What we didn't like was paying $17 for enchilladas. Don't get me wrong, they use quality, fresh ingredients and the food is well prepared. But it was only a small notch above the place I typically go to back home and they only charge $8 for a comparable dish.",1.0,0
"2/3 of my vegetarian fajitas plate was white rice and really runny refried beans. The little pile of sauteed veggies (the supposed fajitas) was totally bland. So I asked for some hot sauce, expecting the usual bottle of tabasco or similar.  The waiter appeared quite a while later with a little dish of something that looked like a liquid chipotle mayo and said: ""hot sauce.""  What he failed to mention was that it was a side of habanero salsa (at least 100 times hotter than your regular cayenne chili variety, according to Scoville scale) and that he was charging us $2 for it.  How come when a waiter brings you a warm plate, s/he is required to warn you that it's hot; and they fail to warn you that the sauce is made with habanero peppers?  Don't get me wrong: I love very spicy food. And it was my mistake to not taste the sauce before adding it, somewhat recklessly, to my plate.  Well, it went from bland to inedible. When we tried to complain, the waiter laughed and said ""Yes, it's VERY VERY hot.""  Did I ask for VERY VERY hot sauce? No. Why did you decide to bring me the hottest of your variety of salsas, charge me $2 for a tiny serving and fail to inform me about either of these facts? No idea.A few notes in addition to the spasms of my fire-engulfed esophagus:1. Ok but not exciting food2. Overpriced, small portions3. Trying to be upscale and authentic but failing at both (nothing compared to the yummy food anywhere in Mexico)4. Packed with shrieking kids (did they also ask for some hot sauce???)",4.0,1
"We had a very nice dinner here.  The menu is a bit different from a typical Mexican restaurant.  This is not Americanized Tex-Mex.  There are several, unique dishes on the menu.  They have a kids menu too.  The guacamole is made to order in a stone bowl, is a big portion, and absolutely delicious.  We had friendly service from Elvin.  The decor inside is welcoming and interesting.  The margaritas were excellent and they have a great, varied tequila menu.  We had the chicken enchiladas verdes (they were just okay) and my bride had chicken fajitas.  They were different, not sizzling, but tasted good.  They twins had chicken quesadillas.  Put all of that together, and we had a very pleasant experience.  We will be back!",1.0,0
"Mediocre food but really poor service.  We went in early on a Saturday night and was seated next to the hidden door to the restroom.

"My fiance and I had dinner at this restaurant while on vacation in the Berkshires. The man at the front desk of our hotel recommended it, so we gave it a try.The decor is fun, and our waiter was very polite (though he didn't speak much English). However, the food was not what we expected based on what we paid for it. The complimentary tortilla chips came with a small bowl of pico de gallo (chopped up tomatoes and other various veges and spices) and not the normal liquid salsa I was expecting. When we ordered the ""Nachos con Queso"" as an appetizer, because I wanted that spicy cheese dip that Mexican restaurants are usually known for, we received a small bowl of chips covered in melted, shredded cheese. It looked and tasted the same as when I was 10 years old and would microwave some store brand Mexican cheese over nacho chips and call it dinner.For entrees, my fiance had some type of fish (I don't eat seafood so I don't remember) and he said it was good. I ordered tacos and specified that I only wanted the meat, lettuce, cheese, taco sauce, and sour cream in them (I don't do tomatoes or onions). I politely asked the waiter to write this down so he would remember, and he scribbled something on a notepad. When my tacos arrived to the table, they only had meat, sauce, and lettuce in them. I called the waiter over and asked for some shredded cheese and sour cream (which were all listed as being on the tacos on the menu) and he brought them promptly. However, when we got our bill, he had charged me $2.00 for a side of cheese and $1.00 for a side of sour cream! I didn't complain to the manager over $3.00, but it bothered me enough to mention it in this review.The rice pudding and mango cheesecake were great. The frozen margaritas were ok, but didn't contain enough alcohol for their $9 each pricetag. For an appetizer, two entrees, two desserts, and four margaritas, our bill came to just over $100.Would I go back if I was in the area? Maybe...but probably not.",4.0,1
"5 stars for the cocktails! My mojito was full of muddled fresh strawberries and mint. It was perfectly strong, not too much or too little. 3 stars for food. The guac was excellent but hardly enough for the 3 of us to share.My dining companions got the quesadilla, which was only two thin, short triangles. It looked like something off a children's menu.I ordered the grande pork burrito, which while large, was relatively light on flavor. The pork is tender but bland. I wished we had some more of the delicious guac to smother all over it.4 stars for service. Our server wasn't very helpful with recommendations but she was always around when we needed her.Overall, a nice experience. I like the sunny deck out front.",3.0,0
"EDITED FOR REDUNDANCY 9/10/07- I returned to Xicohtencatl yesterday, and I can't say I was happy. My 10 dollar ensalada de aguacate was simply horrible, especially in comparasion to what I can get back home - how hard is it to source nice romaine instead of inispid gunk here in Organic Farm Land Massachusetts? The dressing was also boring and poorly mixed. Even I can do better.The chile rellenos with spinach was marginally better, but still suffered from a total overdose of not-that-tasty cheese at the bottom, which oddlly enough wasn't mixed with the spinach at all. The spicy sauce accompanying the big poblanos was good, but too water, and turned a rather off-putting color after mixing with the crema up top. Service was nice and friendly as always, and the porch is a really nice place to be this time of winter when a storm is rolling in. But watch out what you order. Authentic mid-country Mexican food in Great Barrington? What the hell? But there you have it. This brightly decorated restaurant is shooting for the real deal in an area that isn't exactly known for its thriving Mexican dining scene, putting forth an ambitious menu. It's a commendable mission, but does it succeed? The interior of the restaurant looks like the fever dream of a Oaxacan wood carving collector - all sorts of intensely colored lizards, dragons, and other animals peering out at you at strange animals. It's location in an old house gives it plenty of character, although the dining room can get a bit chilly in the evening. Chips and a pico de gallo type salsa come free to every table. These were decent renditions, although the chips were a bit greasy and ""heavy"" for my taste. The salsa really had nothing to commend or detract from it - you've had this fresh finely chopped stuff before. (And it's not spicy either.)The menu is large and features a wide variety of authentic Mexican dishes, rarely found in your average Mexican joint. There's a good selection of moles, enchilada dishes, some interesting mushroom related vegan specialties, and even some seafood, including a fried rainbow trout in verde sauce I was sorely tempted to order. There's also a selection of burritos and tacos for the less adventurous types. One warning: this place is *expensive*, especially for a Mexican restaurant. Price gouging isn't exactly unusual in the Berkshires, but something about dropping 17 bucks on a plate of chicken mole I've had before for 7 is a little grating to me. We ordered some guacamole. Xicoh's rendition is a bit unusual - it appeared to be finely pureed in a blender with a spicy kick of tomatillo sauce. This produced a somewhat smoother, gloppier texture then I prefer in my own guacamole, but the flavor was very crsip, spicy, and good. I just wish they'd mash it with a fork instead of throw it in a machine.My entree was the Pipian Con Pollo, featuring small pieces of chicken simmered in a lurid orange chipotle and sesame seed sauce. This was very tasty and had a decent quantity of spice - I could tell I was tasting something interesting. My only complaint is that the accompanying rice was extremely substandard (and why put hard, dried peas and corn in it, anyway?) My dining companion's selection were the Costillas de Puerco Con Chipotle - a small rack of pork ribs marinated in achiote paste, grilled, and served covered in a chipotle sauce. Although the amount of sauce was somewhat small, the rib I tried was cooked to a perfect degree - the meat was tender and almost sweet. This was accompanied by that same damn mediocre rice. Both entrees came with a bowl of warmed and not-half-bad corn tortillas - another testament to the restaurant's attempt at authenticity. Other dishes I've tried here include a bang-up rendition of chilaquiles (10.00),  served for lunch. This dish features shredded corn chips in a super-tangy verde sauce, accompanied by a little sour cream and some tender shredded chicken. It's a spicy, carby wonder and simply divine for lunch. They also serve a red version for dinner - definitely worth a try. I've also enjoyed the Chile Rellenos De Espinaca, which are two roasted Anaheim chilies filled with a mixture of spinach and cheese. Although they weren't cooked to the level of soulful char that I really adore, they were certainly tasty, providing a nice alternative to the deep fried-and-egg drenched hedonism that a Tex-Mex chile relleno provides. Service is quick if a little brusque at times. The evening we were there, a couple of loud and increasingly drunk middle aged women filled us in about the state of their breasts in extremely distressing detail - be prepared to overhear every single shred of other people's discussions if you're seated in the booth. Xicohtencatl provides a truly impressive tequila and margarita menu, which is definitely worth perusing if you're one of those lucky jerks who are of the official drinking age. (But that's another rant.)",3.0,0
"I decided to round up to three stars from a 2.5 food star experience mainly because I loved the fact that Matt J. and I could actually try a Berkshire area Mexican spot. It is super colorful and we definitely took some awesome photos here where we saw a different type of color in comparison to the fall colors we made out trip for!The food was just okay though. I also don't like having to pay extra for chips and salsa--call me a spoiled Californian, but I think everyone pretty much associates getting Mexican food with chips and salsa so it should be part of the experience. Prices on the main brunch dishes were very reasonable though, but I wouldn't say it was the best food in the world, but that pineapple agua fresca was quite delicious!!! Matt J. and I could have drank another pitcher of that easily for sure. Food wise we got a special stewed chicken and rice that was just so so and a chile relleno dish that was also just so so. It was all fine, but really for Mexican I was expecting more seasoning and such, but the service was great, we could sit outside on their awesome porch, so it was a great stopping point on our trip! And don't change the decor at all! So fun!",4.5,1
"So bummed.  We always liked this place and had a number of nice dinners there, but something must have gone wrong this season.We arrived around 8 which didn't seem late, we wanted to sit outside so we got a table and as I sat down my chair was wet, turns out the bus staff throws the water off the porch and I guess they don't care whether it gets on the chairs.  Ok we got through that.  Anyway that led me to look around, straws, drink tops, paper under the tables.  I guess they don't care about cleaning up either.  Order margaritas, no salt, guess not... salt it is. but it gets worse.  Portions were small, my son's burrito was all rice.  He's only ten but he knew enough to say something to me.  I had fajitas ($22) barely had enough to share with my son.  My wife ordered some guacamole to fill up the kids... good money after bad, you get a half bowl of chips and the tiniest ""taster"" of guac.Bug zapper is going full blast, it was quite funny actually if there wasn't a bill associated with it.

"I have decided to drop my previous 4 star rating from 2 years ago because this place has changed. For the worse.The reason? Service has dropped dramatically in quality (the last time we ate there we waited a half hour for the waiter to come after we were seated). The past four times we have eaten there, we finally make our order, and then we do not see the waiter for another half hour. Doesnt check in on us, doesnt seem to really be concerned about our table at all. Have to say, the drinks have dropped in quality as well. The drinks Im referring to are the $10 Margaritas and Mojitos - and at that price they should be killer!The food has remained pretty good. Still in the pricey side, but the portions of the entrees are big. There are alternatives now in town for Mexican fare, and until I hear that the service here has gotten better, we will pass on Xicoh.",5.0,1
"I have dined here many times and am always surprised at it authenticity (as good Mexican food as you can get anywhere).  I have family in Mexico, visit frequently and frankly like the moles at Zicoh better than any I have ever had in Oaxaca!  The owners are wonderful, margaritas spectacular, and the service friendly... If you want really good Mexican food, this is the place to go. Try their crepes, their moles, the fabulous desserts .....",3.0,0
"Been here roughly three times and each time it is a decent eating experience, but not earth shattering by any means.  They make an honest attempt to serve authentic Mexican cuisine, in addition to the tacos/burritos fare that is to be expected, and they make use of organic and local ingredients to the extent that they can and for that I give them a lot of credit,. but somehow, it doesn't ever add up to a four star or five star experience.For example, I order the Ceviche Tropical, and it was generous far beyond my expectations (some might even say gratuitous) but it was obviously not freshly prepared, but rather spooned out of a refrigerated stockpile of the stuff. and although it got better as it thawed out, it was just indelicate, and a little tough.Another example - Kim ordered the signature soup, which includes a crab claw dunked into the tomato base, but how the hell are you supposed to address a crab claw dunked in tomato broth without making a royal mess of yourself?  And even if you were game, there are no claw cracking tools provided.  It looks good but is a totally impractical fantasy.  My Macho Grande shrimp selection was tasty but really, nothing special.  And the Tres Leches desert was overdone, with condensed milk dressing drowning the cake, and despite the dousing, the pastry was not juicy, as it is supposed to be, but more like mexican pound cake.   The hand made hot chocolate was, however, outstanding.And the menu is too large.  It's all great sounding but has a tendency to blend into blandness due to the repetition of ingredients in each and every dish.  I would prefer a smaller selection with more attention paid to each preparation.I liked the drinks - I had a Diablo Margarita, which consisted of Tequila, Lime, Cilantro, Brandy and Jalapeno and it was quite tasty.All in all, if you're in the area and you have a hankering for Mexican, it's a worthy choice, especially compared to the typical taco/burrito oriented restaurant and especially in the warmer weather when the patio areas are open for dining.",2.0,0
"The food was okay. The service, however, was terrible. One person seated us (typical) and another took our drink order. Waited 20 minutes for drinks until the actual waitress finally showed to take our order. That was the second to last time we saw her. A different person brought the food. No one checked on us to see if we needed more drinks or water. Eventually someone (another unfamiliar face) swung by to collect our plates and we asked for the waitress (to get the check). Waited fifteen minutes, no one showed. This is when it gets good. We are sitting at our table still waiting for signs of life to come and take my money when a friendly PIT BULL comes running up to our table. Fortunately I like dogs so I gave her a nice pat, but what the hell is a dog doing running around a restaurant seating area? Turns out it was the owner's dog and was promptly collected by... the hostess maybe? We were seated outside, so I got up and entered the restaurant and approached the closest employee I could find and asked if I could please pay for my meal. She went and got the waitress from some recess in the restaurant. I payed at the bar, refusing to allow her out of my sight again because I didn't know how long I would be waiting to sign the receipt. How much of a tip did I leave? Hah. Will never go back. Portions were very small for a mexican restaurant and the prices outrageous (for what is basically just beans and rice).",1.0,0
"Just had dinner here, not at all impressed. I had the Carnitas (pork) Burrito. I have never had such tough pork, which was listed as being ""slow-cooked"", which typically should make the pork very tender. It tasted like it had been around a long time and then been microwaved to heat it, which with pork tends to distort the flavor of the pork. It was also mostly rice and beans inside. If I had wanted a bean burrito, I would have gone to Taco Bell, although their food might be better! Would not recommend this place!",3.0,0
"Want to like it more than I did. Food is tasty and fresh, but portions are small, so that both my friend and I left hungry!! Not hungry like we hadn't eaten, just hungry like we weren't satiated.The Sangria was very watered down, barely had much taste.And it's expensive.",4.0,1

"This place was ok, maybe even good. However, the guacamole they put on the nachos is not real guacamole, it's that bright green kind you buy prepackaged at the supermarket. But the funny is, they DO have real guacamole, but only if you order the guacamole. Strange. Also, my husband ordered the rib eye and they served him a T bone. Don't try to deceive your customers. Left a bad taste in my mouth and therefore won't be back.",4.5,1
"My food was, okay.  The halibut was dry, as was the rice.  Perhaps fish was a bad order, but they had several fish options so I thought they might have had a good fish source.  The best thing was the margarita: there was a good amount of tequila and they were not too sweet.",2.0,0

"Stopped in with a group for a late-ish dinner after our rehearsal at Tanglewood on a Friday night.  Pretty packed, but a table for 6 was free for us.  It was EXTREMELY hot outside so we were fine that they only had an indoor table, but the A/C needs some work in there.Service was great, menu is huge (could use a little more focus, or at least direction to patrons).  Friends got margaritas which they seemed to like - I shared some mango agua fresca (basically water blended with mango puree as far as I could tell).Chips were delicious, the guacamole especial was good but perhaps a bit expensive.  I ordered the Chicken Mole Crepes which were awesome, and perfectly spicy/chocolatey.  For $18 they had good flavor, and there was plenty of it.  Friends seemed happy with their shrimp fajitas.Overall a good place to go with friends when you want mexican food.  Nothing fancy, prices a bit high on average, but a good hang-out spot if you're not expecting to be wowed.  A-OK.",5.0,1

"Great place. Main courses were delicious. Free table salsa was yummy and surprisingly spicy. They have a very good kids menu with some simple basics and even french fries for the kids who won't try anything. The margaritas were very flavorful. I tried the El Diablo, which was VERY spicy but not in an unmanageable way.Only complaint was that the special house guacamole was really super bland. Not sure what was missing but it was disappointing. That was the only down note on a great meal. The Carnitas was great!",4.0,1
"The reviews of this place are all over the map.    We only stopped in for drinks and an appetizer after a hike.  It was too early for dinner, so this review will be a bit limited. But this place is far superior to that disappointing Brew Pub right down the street.It was about 4, and we had just finished a hike on Mt Everett. First thing we notice, this place is staffed by folks who actually appear to be Mexican. That's a good sign. Chips, fresh salsa, and water were promptly delivered.   We each had the El Corazon margarita, on the rocks. Mine with salt, the missus without.  They were a tad expensive at $12 a pop, but very good.  I prefer Cointreau over Grand Marnier, but they didn't seem to offer that option.   Still, good second choice, better than Triple Sec.We also shared a Ceviche, and that was very nice too. Big chunks of white fish, and other stuff in there.  Served with more freshly made chips.   They were chowing on salad with large grilled shrimp at the table next to ours, and that looked pretty good too.   If the opportunity comes up,  we will certainly give the full dinner a shot.   The only nit, and it's a small one, is that they could use something to block the noise from the busy street.",5.0,1

Loved this place - as previous reviews note chips/salsa are rationed or you are charged & drinks - while delic - are too pricey - 12$ for normal sized margarita! That being said I got the 3 diff flavored of enchiladas and they were the best I have ever had but for 15$ portions are small. It's a ramekin size of rice on the side. My cat eats more! The mole sauce in particular was tdf! My bf got the carnitas and loved it. Flan was a huge disappointment - tasted burnt :(,5.0,1

"Perhaps some of the most delicious, fresh, authentic mexican food I've enjoyed in the Northeast to date. I'm sure there are less discovered restaurants and simplified menus to be seen, but frankly I don't believe purist is always perfection. Their guacamole is very simple with avocado, cilantro, tomatoes, onion, and just the right squeeze of lime. Seafood, Mole, Tofu, Tacos... What can't be enjoyable here? Their nonalcoholic drinks are magnificent on a hot evening and round off fine meals complete with wonderful deserts from crepes to sweet milk cake.",4.0,1

They make all of the food fresh, including the chips, which are some of the best homemade tortilla chips I've had. Their margaritas are very very good and definitely unique. The food isn't overloaded with cheese or grease like most places. Instead it's fresh and pretty healthy. Their chicken soft tacos are very good. Sitting on the wrap-around porch in the summer is really nice.",4.0,1
"Went here for lunch.  Great Ambiance.   I had the chicken Fajitas.  Very authentic Mexican tastes with a nice hot Jalapeno in the rice.  gripe: only one tortilla was served with the meal.  usually, other restaurants give 3.  I complained and heard it was $1 for each extra tortilla.  I was brought another for free..  If you need a chip refill... $2.My wife had  a veggie buritto she thought it was OK.  Daughter had a chicken enchilada.  OK again.  For my picky 5 year old son, they graciously made a sauteed chicken dish for him.  It was really oily but, a nice gesture.  $4 for each kid meal is cheap.  They should charge $6 for the kids and remove the chip and tortilla charges.We will return.",4.0,1

Almost TOO fast. I ordered enchiladas which were not phenomenal, but very tasty & a good sized portion of 3. I could only finish 2. Husband got fajitas - same...not phenomenal, but he ate them all.

I had seasoned grilled shrimp which were excellent, but the real surprise was the bed of rice that came with them - flavorful, a little crunchy, absolutely delicious.

"I really liked the food here and thought that the service was great. The atmosphere was really nice. It was clean and festive inside. A great place to go out with an old friend (as I did!). My main complaint is the price. We ordered margaritas, which were pretty strong and tasty, but can't remember the price on those. We got ordered house made guacamole, which was fantastic, but was $9.00. For my meal I ordered an enchildada (which I made vegan by holding off on the cheese). The enchilada is $16.00! Being from California, where delicious mexican food is abundant, I have never paid such prices! The good thing is that the portion was pretty large and the food was indeed fresh and satisfying. I took some home for lunch the next day. Probably wouldn't return because of the prices, but they do have good food and service if you are willing to pay a bit more.",1.0,0
"The only thing good about this place was the waiter. Obviously he had no fault in the horrible food or control of the kitchen or management. First the huge plate of fajitas were served with two mediocre tortillas wrapped up in a napkin. I could have had more but ""there was a price"". My friend ordered the tostadas. Which you would think should be a no brainer. So when the attitude filled manager came out and started to inform us of how they instead of asking us what the issues were and then proceeded to argue that ""nobody has ever complained about the amount of tortillas"" (which I found very hard to believe) she then proceeded to try and fumble an excuse for the ice cold chicken on top of the tostadas. She said that if warm ingredients were put on a tostada it would make the tostada soggy. But somehow the magic hot beans under the chicken didn't seem to matter? Has she ever had a taco? A taquito? A chimichanga? All of those pull off the amazing feat of holding hot Ingredients without becoming soggy. Clearly she was grasping at straws, Which now that I think about it I'm shocked there wasn't a charge for. Hey manager lady, next time don't argue with a customer and also you might want to read your yelp reviews. Before I stopped reading the bad reviews I think I counted 5 people complaining about the portions and specifically the amount of tortillas with the fajitas! So I guess the customer IS always right after all. As sad as it is to say I would recommend driving another 30 minutes to Taco Bell.",2.0,0
"Supremely Disappointing. Haven't been here in many years so we were looking forward to our return visit. Same nice decor and strong but pricey margaritas. The special winter pozole soup was a tasty appetizer but not the traditional thick stew I have had other places. When their signature mole came to the table, it was cold and I had to send it and rice back for heating. When it returned the chicken was rubbery and tough and the sauce was spicy but lacked all the subtle chocolate and chili flavors in a better version. My husband had enchiladas Rojas and felt he had had better Mexican at Chipotle. Will not be rushing back.",5.0,1

"This place has pretty decent food and the service is good but there is one thing that has happened to me on both visits to Xicohtencatl; We ordered the guacamole. It came out and was quite a large portion and very good. It was served with a very small basket of chips - not nearly enough for the amount of guacamole. We asked for more chips. Moments later the chips arrive. No salsa was served, We asked for some. Moments later, salsa arrives. When the bill arrives - THEY CHARGED FOR THE CHIPS AND FOR THE TINY CUP OF SALSA! Noting on the menu regarding pricing of a extra chips and some salsa with the chips. IF YOU ASK FOR SOMETHING BE SURE TO ALSO ASK - HOW MUCH?!",4.5,1
"We should have driven past this restaurant.  The service was slow beyond belief, with an order of juice in an unpopulated restaurant taking over 30 minutes, and just as long to have my order taken while diners arriving after me were seeing drinks and appetizers.  One of our party had to send back everything because the food kept coming out laced with something she told the waitress she was allergic to.  Did the waitress merely try to pick out the allergen with her fingers? Anyone with a food allergy knows how microscopic amounts of the allergen can cause a full-blown reaction. My burrito (without the tortilla to make it gluten free) was bland and unremarkable, and I am pretty sure that diet coke is brown and more opaque than transparent.  I had no appetizer, no booze and no dessert, and for $18, if I can't get food with some imagination, a smile and some attention from the server shouldn't be that much to ask for.  While the diner with a food allergy had to give up and watch the rest of us eat with no food in front of her, and while I found this to be the worst bargain in the Berkshires, other members of our party seemed to enjoy their alcoholic beverages quite a bit.  If you need food to slow down the buzz and won't die of anaphylaxis when the kitchen screws up the same order multiple times, I suppose this is as good a place as any to tie one on.  Just pop by Catherine's afterward and buy chocolates for your designated driver, because without alcohol, his experience will be abysmal. Overpriced, teenagers waiting tables with no adult supervision, and God help you if you have anywhere to go after your meal or have a food allergy.",2.0,0

"This place did not live to my expectations. Being from Las Vegas, NV, Mexican food is one of my favorites. Xicohtencatl don't know how to cook rice. Their rice is half cooked. Their tortilla chips appetizer is so limited that I swear there are less than 10 chips in that basket. They placed the salsa in the basket to make it look like there's plenty of chips in the basket. In addition their burrito is the worst I ever had. My friends that I was dinning with we're not happy either. The worst part was the waitress did not come back at all after I returned the half cooked rice. I will not go back to this restaurant again. I won't recommend this to anyone.",2.0,0

Glad we made reservations though it's off season as the place got filled very quickly after we arrived. The service is fabulous ! The food amazing. The variety of vegetarian items on the menu is vast. Fresh chopped salsa, not the stuff that looks like it came in a jar. Fresh chips - piping hot. Great guacamole with yummy chunky avocado. All awesome. I had the 'Attack of the mushrooms' which was amazing with a variety of mushrooms. My wife had the salmon tacos - it's really refreshing to see fish tacos with salmon (I hate tilapia).

"I began with trepidation - made a reservation for one on the porch, they had me down as four inside. Then the salsa was breathtakingly hot - not a bad thing and I like spicy food, but wow, it tasted like it was just tomatoes but then 3 glasses of water later I was still sniffling and sweating. But the mole was all they claim - the smokiness, subtle heat, and depth of flavor were astonishing. (The actual piece of chicken was a tad overdone and therefore tough.) The pile of rice that came with it was the fluffiest rice I've ever eaten, perfect for soaking up the sauce (as were the corn tortillas, which came out soft, thick, warm). I don't usually stay for dessert but when the entree's that good, I figure I should try it. The flan was obviously homemade and was so dense and rich, but the actual custard wasn't sweet, relying on the caramel poured over it to sweeten the dish. Nothing wrong with that, but if you like sweeter desserts, you might want one of the others. (And they had a more comprehensive dessert menu than I usually see at a Mexican restaurant.) Excellent service from all staff members. Really outstanding experience.",4.5,1

"Truly one of the worst meals we've ever had.   Ended up there after hours of tubing.  Was packed, so figured it would be good.  We were seven people (three adults, four kids) put at two tiny tables pushed together jammed in a tiny restaurant.  All of this would have been acceptable if the food or service were decent.  To start we ordered sangria which came out in a carafe with glasses filled with ice and seltzer.  Weird.  We were given two baskets of chips and pico de gallo which was good, but they advise on the menu that while the first basket is on the house, subsequent baskets will be charged at $2 per.   Ordered guacamole at $13 per order.  They only used one avocado in each order.  When we saw how little there was, we ordered another.  When we tasted the first we realized that it needed salt and lemon.  The second order had too much lemon.  So we combined the two to make them edible.   I ordered shrimp fajitas.  The shrimps were undercooked.  I asked a random waiter (not ours, our waitress disappeared and did not bother to return even with the additional baskets of chips and salsa we ordered but never got) to have them cooked better.  He came back a few minutes later to tell me that the chef said that they were cooked, they were pre-cooked, and might I want something else.  I said ""no, I'd like what I ordered, but cooked.""  About 10 minutes later they came back teeny tiny (because now they were cooked and had shrunk.)  My friend's son wanted black beans but they only served refried beans.  The rice that was served was minute rice which was clumpy, starchy and a big paste ball.   The rice my son ordered never came out, which given the quality was okay, but we were charged for it - $3!  My friend order hot sauce and was charged $2 for it!  The meal cost $150, a total rip-off.  My local Mexican restaurant is 100 times better and costs half as much.  They clearly have a captive audience as there is very little in the area for after skiing.  We would have been better off with the vending machines at the ski lodge.",5.0,1
"The five stars is for the appetizer, camerones machos. Shrimp the size of the palm of your hand, sauteed in butter, lime and jalapeno, served over fresh greens. Whoa. This might be the best appetizer I've ever had that involved shrimp. Be prepared that this requires peeling and you must not be afraid to make a mess. This is not a first-date kind of item to order.The mole sauce is worth it. It's not sweet. It's spicy and chocolate and wonderfully delicious. Although they are a bit stingy on the meat, served with corn tortillas and rice it was filling, if not seeming like filler.The calamari appetizer is beautiful and flavorful, but overcooked. Not fried!The wait staff was wonderfully friendly and knowledgeable and the drinks are well prepared and presented. Had a house margarita and it was divine. No sour mix involved.They have a lovely deck to eat outside.Authentic and extensive menu.Their website is quite helpful http://www.xicohmexican.com/",1.0,0
"I could not wait to pay and leave!! The three plates we order were amazingly flavorless not to mention that the portions were extremely small. Sitting inside... we had to kill three flies and two mosquitoes. Marginal service, didn't offer drinks, chips (served only by request)... Again, could not wait to pay and leave. I am never going back or recommending this place.",4.0,1
"Not your typical Tex-Mex, this stylish restaurant serves imaginative fare using ingredients and flavors from south of the border in the very northern setting of the Berkshires in Massachusetts.  The cilantro-rich salsa was made with fresh tomatoes, and the vegetable fajitas were bright and tasty.  I would love to return and try the chiles rellenos made with shiitake mushrooms.",2.0,0
"With such a promising name, we thought perhaps we had finally found good Mexican food in Massachusetts. We were wrong. The food is bland and like something you would get in a chain ""Mexican"" restaurant. Servers were very nice, decor is pretty. Unfortunate food.",5.0,1

"This restaurant is just awesome.  Great food, consistently improves year after year.  I love the Mole, Authentic Mexican dining.  Great drinks, friendly service.  Easy choice to make.",4.5,1
Love the food here. The mole is excellent and so are the margaritas.  There is a consistent issue with very spotty service and things seem disorganized in how they are run.  Get the service straightened out and I will give it 5 stars.,1.0,0
"Where do I start... Food was good portions were pitiful. I went hungry and left hungry despite the fact that I ordered a full sized meal... Everything is so far overpriced... Took 45 minutes for them to figure out the check... No apology about the wait and they acted like it was our fault... We live locally but will not be returning. Yes it was authentic, yes it was expensive and yes I really wanted to love this place but the service was terrible.",3.0,0

"Three of us stayed just part of a day & overnight in Great Barrington. Our motel desk man recommended the Xicohtencatl Mexican Restaurant. My wife had a version of a taco Salad. It was kind of Tex-Mex.  She said it was ""OK"". Our friend got a vegetarian enchilada which she liked. They had Modelo beer that she likes that evidently most Mexican restaurants do not have.  I got the Camarones Machos Grande which I LOVED. This was real Mexican food...  shrimp (large) over sort of braised greens over yellow rice! I spent a month in Mexico years ago. My meal was equal to the best of my meals in Mexico. I also had a Margarita which was very good. The service was prompt & efficient. I thought that the prices were reasonable. Would I go back? Yes, but my meal was so good that I am not sure that I would order anything else for a while.",1.0,0
"Way too expensive, not nearly good enough, and close inspection of the menu revealed that they sneak in all sorts of extra hidden charges. For example: the first basket of chips and salsa comes free. After that, refills of chips are free. Refills of salsa are $1.00. Yet refills of chips and salsa are $1.50.Will charge you $2.00 for a tiny cup of guacamole, sour cream, or hot sauce. Visibly don't treat their waitstaff great. Hostess was kind of cold. And overall, not good enough food to justify the prices. Never coming back.",1.0,0
"Dined there in July 2009.Pros:--Decor: This place is, as other reviewers have noted, very nicely decorated. Very colorful and on a nice day, sitting outside on the porch is a wonderful option.--Waitstaff: Very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.--Food: not really a pro because it;s so greasy/butery, often takes a long time, and there aren't many truly healthy options. But some of it is tasty.Cons:--Management/Doesn't treat waitstaff well: Very cold, unfriendly, and unhelpful, When I called in to make reservations, the manager was brusque and I had to press her for each piece of information! They also force the waitresses to make change out of their own wallets, something I witnessed when I went up to the bar to pay and saw the poor waitress scrambling through her wallet. Outrageous! This instance and other things I have heard lead me to believe they do not treat their waitstaff well. As a former waitress, this bothers me!--Greasy, slow food: already covered this,--OVERPRICED: said often on this website, and very true. They charge $2.00 extra for a tiny side of hot sauce, and often don't tell you about things like this.This place has potential, but as it is right now it's just not worth the inflated prices.",4.0,1
Love the food and the service. Very authentic Mexican cuisine.  The atmosphere was festive.,2.0,0
"The food is okay, and even better than average sometimes, but the prices were recently jacked up about $5 per more dish than our last visit. And it wasn't cheap to begin with. The last time we went, we had two entrees - no apps, no dessert, and stuck with water. It still ran us $50 and we left hungry. The staff seems bothered by the customers. It's unlikely we'll be returning.",4.0,1

"My family & I love this place!  We discovered this wonderful restaurant last year for the first time, and were excited all year 'round to go again.  (We come to Great Barrington each winter to ski.) The food is incredible and the service is even better.  Just go.  You'll be glad you did.  (And don't forget to make a reservation for those busy weekend nights.)

"I've eaten food all over Mexico, and I have to say this was one of the blandest ""Mexican"" meals I've had.  The mole was two dimensional, probably the worst I've had, but what really got me was the super small portions and $14 guacamole.  Really??  And when we asked for sour cream on the side, they gave us about a tablespoon and charged a dollar for it!  Good grief.  It's that kind of petty thing that completely turns me off.  I have to say the service was friendly and efficient, hence two stars instead of one.  Never again.  I've had better food at less than half the price.",5.0,1
"I was surprised to see how many negative reviews this place received, since we loved it.  It may have helped that we went there on a Thursday, when it was far from empty but not jammed.  We found the food well prepared and didn't think it was especially expensive at all.  We sat on the deck on a summer evening, had a great margarita and totally enjoyed our meals.  And for us the service was fantastic.  Everyone seemed friendly and eager to be helpful, and we had a great talk with our waitress.  Being there added to our enjoyment of our outing in the Berkshires.",4.0,1
"I don't know where  the negative reviewers have been eating - surely not at Xicoh! I love Mexican food, but good versions are hard to find. Xicoh's food is better than just good - and I've never been  served ""white rice and runny beans"". The service has always been friendly and for the most part attentive. Makes me wonder if they run a separate kitchen for whiners who think that TexMex is the benchmark.",5.0,1
"We love this place!  They serve organic salads and great Mexican food for New England.  Wished they offered black beans but unfortunately, the only beans they offer are re-fried.  Service is great, atmosphere authentic and wonderful alfresco dining in the warmer months.  Easy parking as they have their own lot.",4.0,1
"We visit the Berkshires often, but never stopped here before. We are glad we did.  First of all, It is not quite 4-stars, but definitely more than 3. I don't know what distinguishes Tex Mex from Mex, but I do know that Xicoh's served us some good food. We had a couple of very well made cocktails -- a mojito and a margarita.  A small basket of fresh but slightly greasy chips with pico de gallo was just okay - there is a charge for a refill.  Then we shared very tasty beef and chicken enchiladas served with a nice mole and a so-so salsa verde, very good refried beans with rice; and a surprisingly excellent burrito made with grilled chicken.  Barrington is quiet in winter despite a local ski area so the restaurant was not packed.  Under such conditions, the service was acceptable and the ambiance is, well, informal, I guess. The prices are not cheap, but overall good value and  we plan to return.",2.0,0
"Staff was pleasant but not the food or drinks. We've come here on an yearly basis, and learned the hard way that things really do change in a year. The frozen margaritas wee tasteless, the sprite was flat, the guacamole was very watery, dishes were not exceptional, except the one that came with a cricket.  Not planning to return unless we hear that things change.",1.0,0
"One star because of three strikes.  First, the worst nickel-and-dime  restaurant I have ever been to.  Second, bland food and small portions.  Third, horrible  attitude by management.  I hate restaurants that nickel-and-dime.  It's bad enough we have to put up with it from airlines. My wife and I came here for lunch.  After ordering a half-carafe of Sangria and a Margarita, we asked for chips and salsa to nosh on while we waited for our food. Sure, the waitress said, a small basket of chips for $2.  My wife ordered fajitas. She asked whether she could have some cheese. Of course,  the waitress said, a small plastic cup of shredded cheese for another $2. It really is not the $4.  It's the principle of the thing.  When I go to a restaurant with tablecloths and waiters and corresponding prices, I don't want to be nibbled to death with extra charges.  Just price your food appropriately.   But what really got me was management's attitude. On the way out, I politely told the manager that this was a bad practice.  His response was to tell me that ""it's a business"" (a bad one) and that ""all Mexican restaurants charge extra for chips and salsa"" (a lie, as probably everyone reading this knows).  He then had the b***s to ask why I would expect something for free.  I  gave him a piece of my mind, which I won't recount here.  Suffice it to say, I won't be back, although we have a summer home here and come by a few times every summer.   Too bad, the place has a nice porch and the Margaritas  are pretty good.  However, the food comes in small portions and is probably the blandest  Mexican food this side of Taco Bell, although quite a bit pricier.  All of these flaws have been amply noted by other reviewers. I actually hate writing bad reviews.  But I've decided that if a restaurant is disrespectful to customers, whether in attitude or actions, I'm going to note the fact and not just keep it to myself.  The owner of this restaurant might want to read the reviews of his restaurant before he starts charging extra for salt and pepper.",1.0,0
"Ordered takeout from here upon recommendation from a friend.  Food was bland and the 4 dishes we ordered tasted the same. After I paid I asked for an extra pico de gallo on the side, to which the hostess Said ""would you like to place an order for one? That will be $1.50....."" When I asked the host to double check there were chips in the Togo bag he said yes there were chips. When I got home there were no chips in the bag. I called up and he could care less. He didn't even invite me to come back to the restaurant to pickup some. Awful customer service!!! Save your time and find another restaurant that cares about their customers!",4.5,1

"Expensive, upscale mexican food that generally hits the mark. What keeps us from visiting more regularly is the consistently poor service.

"I will say first off that my review here is based primarily on the extremely poor service we received when we recently had dinner at this restaurant.  To begin, our reservation did not  appear to exist when we arrived.  We were informed of this by the owner, with absolutely no apology.  We were asked to wait at the bar, which we did, thinking it would be about a ten minute wait.  After 45 minutes, the owner came and asked us if we still wanted a table.  I was rather surprised atThis question but we all heartily agreed that we were starving.  He left again, presumably to continue to look for that elusive table for three.  After another long wait , he came back and said that if we still wanted the table we were going to have to come that minute.  Excuse me?  We had been waiting at this point over an hour and a half.  As the conversation was great and the restaurant very busy we thought we were being beyond patient and understanding, but at this point we were extremely annoyed.  The owner's attitude was one of annoyance at us !  Very confusing!  I will suffice it to say that the food was very good and that once the waitress appeared ( yet another 15 min wait) we were we'll served.  Had I not eaten at this restaurant many times I would never go back, but as I live in the area and have never had a similar experience I will give it another try.",4.0,1

Yes I'm fan and I have been a fan for a while. That being said I do have a few complaints. We visited the restaurant over the weekend. Meals and drinks were very good. We sat on the wrap around porch which was also very pleasant. While we had decent service the server was not as pleasant as she could have been. Is this so bad? Well the meal and experience is better when the person who serves you your meal has a happy pleasant demeanor. Ok so not the worst thing that could have happened. After we had dinner we had leftovers as we always do. We asked our server to wrap them up to go. On our plates was plenty of sauce which adds to the flavor and enjoyment of having the meal. When we got home and opened our containers we saw that there was no sauce included in our meal. We were very disappointed to say the least. It was then that it made perfect sense to me that a server who I suspected did not like what she was doing would not take the time and effort to add the leftover sauce to our takeout containers. Next time we will ask that it be included and in addition ask for extra on the side to ensure that we have enough sauce.  Just a heads up for others who like to eat here.,4.5,1
"Party of 11 (of which we had 6 kids 7yrs old and younger) had a reservation and were promptly seated.  We were seated all the way to the left of the restaurant which is sort of ""outdoor patio"" although enclosed but not very warm.  Chairs were flimsy at best and definitely not child friendly based on the fact that 4 of the kids fell off chairs.  Table was sort of like a picnic table and had slats in it so needless to say we lost a lot of silverware!  Waitress was mediocre at best and service was slow!  I ordered a grilled shrimp avocado salad......BIG mistake!!! Salad looked great and it came with 4 jumbo shrimp.  The shrimp was not shelled or deveined!?!?!  We complained to the ""manager"" and his response was ""he has served shrimp that way for 11 years and never had a complaint"".....and that he would give us a ""discount"".  For starters I don't even think Red Lobster would serve shrimp that hasn't been deveined!! That is disgusting!!  Response/reaction from management was pathetic!!  Oh yes....our ""discount"" was $4.00 off the salad!?  Lots of lessons to be learned here!! Step up your service, train your managers and teach your chefs how to devein shrimp!!",4.5,1
What a hidden gem in the area! Food was ordered to go but the quality was still great. My wife ordered an open egg sandwich on a croissant and my sister in law ordered a farmers omelet. I had ordered the French toast with a homemade berry compote. I was greeted by a table of beautifully fresh baked goods the moment I stepped in and the gentleman who greeted me ( I'm assuming the owner) completed my order by giving me complimentary muffins and croissants into my order as well. Very generous and accommodating of him. I will make an effort to go back and try lunch or dinner in the future when revisiting the area.,5.0,1

"We love this place, the food, the owner (Craig), the vibe.  Food is amazing...when you can get it. Pleasant & Main is very persnickety requiring reservations (even for breakfast; even when it doesn't seem that busy). I've had breakfast twice and reservations for an additional 2  for special occasion dinners in June and again in September. Each time I arrived to find the restaurant closed.  This makes it a 50% chance you can eat, resulting in a 2.5 of 5 rating for food and service, which at best is slow and surly.Food (when available) 5Ambiance 5Service 3Note:  Regarding reservations, P&M has no answering machine and the establishmentarian told me that he does not check his web site for reservations. When the restaurant is allegedly open, no one answers the phone. For the first special event dinner (12 ppl from out of town for a graduation dinner), I made the reservation in person. The waitress didn't know if there was a reservation book. Craig added the reservation to a calendar and had me write all the details on a note pad.  He said he had a possible catering event that night and would contact me if he could not accommodate our party. I received no call, text nor email.",3.0,0
"We had a lovely late breakfast here on a cold Saturday. This place is part breakfast and lunch place, part antique shop. It's utterly charming - there's so much to look at! Great selection of breakfast dishes....the french toast and the pancakes were really good - AND served with real maple syrup (without having to ask or be upcharged for it). Today both were served with a nice berry compote. Croissant breakfast sandwich and farm omelet were also top rate. Don't miss the decadent hot chocolate. Service is quirky which matches the whole vibe of the place. Owner is only concerned you've eaten enough! Check it out - recommend a reservation. I want to go back for lunch because there is an awesome selection of both sweet and savory crepes.",5.0,1

"The Berkshires has a lot of delicious, quality places to enjoy food. But sometimes we want low-key, simple, home-style food.We love antiquing and thrifting, and off-the-beaten-path destinations. When we came across this place and saw they served dinner, we made a reservation. We heard they had closed during the pandemic, but as of July 2022, they were open for dinner.The dinner menu for the evening was simple: a choice of fish fry, chicken pot pie, or a chef's salad. We got the pot pie and the salad. A potato corn chowder was served as a first course. Soup was delicious. It came with a roll, which wasn't special, but the chowder was fresh and flavorful. The main dishes were huge. It was like having dinner at grandma's and being given seconds without asking. Maybe it was because we went in the middle of the week and the weekend crowd wasn't there.We had just completed a five mile hike up Mt Everett and we were famished. We each ate the whole plate of food. The salad was like having thanksgiving leftovers over greens: a smorgasbord. Every bite was delicious. It had berries, steak, chicken, buffalo mozzarella, radishes, carrots, cauliflower, broccoli... and more.After dinner we browsed the store and bought a cookbook.",4.0,1

"I wanted to love this place because it looked so cute and had very good reviews, but sadly it was a huge disappointment. Perhaps my first warning should've been the overload of antiques, we weren't sure if we were in an antique store or a restaurant. I eventually found someone to place a takeout order with and she was nice, a bit frazzled because she was the only server, but nice. My second warning was when she had to go ask if they still had the items I wanted to order available. Which I thought was crazy because they have a very limited menu. However, I thought maybe everything is made fresh and they've sold out of a few items because they're hot items. Not the case. I ordered a Housatonic Burger and a Chicken Pot Pie. The burger had no toppings and for some bizarre reason was broken up into pieces; it was definitely precooked and overcooked. It was so inedible; well at least my dogs enjoyed it. The Chicken Pot Pie wasn't much better. My husband ate half of it and tossed the rest. Very disappointing and I definitely don't recommend going here!",2.0,0

He greeted us with freshly baked scones, muffins and croissants with homemade raspberry jam! There were 7 of us so we had a lot of food! My eggs benedict was delicious and served on a toasted croissant. My boys got an egg, cheese and ham crepe and a dark chocolate and maple syrup crepe that were amazing! The pancakes, open faced croissant sandwich and cappuccinos were all sooooo gooood!! Anything you order will be GREAT! I can't say enough about this place and Greg! Everything about this picturesque town is worth a stop or stay. I wish we had longer to go out on the river and do some fishing or just a boat ride. It's right out of a storybook!

The restaurant had all kinds of antiques and collectibles around the place and outside of the restaurant they had a fire set up where one could roast marshmallows. My grandson had a blast roasting them. I think he would have preferred to stay out there. The food was really good. I had the buttermilk pancakes and the gf had the open face croissant with ham, eggs and cheese. The buttermilk pancakes were so fluffy and were served with fruit and an amazing maple syrup to top it off. The one issue I had was their coffee was only lukewarm. I sent it back and it still came back only warm. Gotta have the piping hot cup of coffee in the morning. My grandson had the Belgian hot chocolate which was served with whipped cream and he loved it.

"I can't say enough good things about this spot. You'll have to go and experience it for yourself, it's truly magical and a must see when visiting the area. I love it here; I'm pretty sure a little part of my heart was left behind today. Long story short: I'm pretty sure I visited Snow White's cottage and had breakfast. The food: fresh and amazing. Felt like a loved one cooked for me. Places that cook with love are rare, but this place is one of them. We were greeted with warm muffins baked that morning upon arrival. We came for breakfast, which was outrageous; I can't imagine what lunch and dinner are like! My husband is a coffee person and he couldn't say enough about how good their coffee was, and that they brew it 'the right way.' Something about an espresso machine being used also... not sure, that's out of my realm! The place: I thought I knew what I was in for after I had peaked online, but photos don't do it justice- at all. Give yourself time to really get a good look around inside. The garden: truly heaven on earth. For a garden junkie like myself, the surroundings are something I've only ever seen in a magazine and dreamed of visiting. I could sit outside at this spot literally all day. And I'm not even kidding. The breeze, the smell from the outdoor fireplace, the outdoor antiques and plants... it's just like heaven. The staff: genuine, down to earth people. They just don't get any nicer. The owner is a total DOLL and he is just simply the best- one of the coolest people I've ever met. Couldn't be any more genuine. He introduced us to his resident chipmunks he hand feeds and then we were able to, too!! One of the coolest moments of my life. This is just such a gem of a place. I could go on and on, I have to stop myself and keep it short. So happy to have visited and we will be back!!",5.0,1

Outdoor dining during the fall is breathtaking with the wood-burning furnace, flowers and foliage everywhere and lovely nooks for eating or sipping coffee while reading the paper. Definitely one of the most quaint venues we've ever experienced. The food was alright. We split the pumpkin pancakes (quite good) and the croque  monsieur (good but not great). I ordered a side of bacon and it was very overcooked. Note: If you're looking for a boozy brunch, there is no alcohol served in this establishment.Overall, this is a really unique and beautiful place to dine.. We would love to come back during our next visit to the Berkshires and try other items on the menu.",4.0,1
"We had an Incredible experience at Pleasant and Main! I made a reservation ahead of time and they kindly setup a nice table for us in the garden outside on our own little porch. The service was very fast, and the whole staff is so friendly. The food was fantastic! All fresh and delicious. I wish I could've ordered even more on the menu. The inside and outside garden is full of antiques and cool artifacts. This really is a one of a kind cafe/restaurant, and I can't wait to come back. This is a must stop in the area.",5.0,1
What a find!  I can't say enough good things about this place. The food was so fresh and so delicious!!  The owner actually picked the vegetables for our salad out of his own garden minutes before serving us.  He and his friends were so friendly and accommodating.  The atmosphere is also fantastic- everything you see is for sale.  Everything is unique. A feast for the eyes and the belly,5.0,1
Eating in the outside garden was a fun experience.  It was a beautiful Sunday September morning.  Our waitress Lea was hustling and our breakfast came quickly.  Food and coffee was delicious!,5.0,1
"From the outside you would not think this place would be a restaurant. Really does look like an antique store. We walked and and waited to be seated. Please was pretty empty at the time. We sat and was brought some water. Place really did have a lot of antiques inside. There seems to be a lot of dust and cobwebs everywhere however I guess this is the look they were going for. As we were trying to order the waiter did not really seem to know his menu very well. None of the specials were offered to us. Other items were told and offered to others that came in the restaurant to eat after us. There was fresh apple pie that was given and offered to two other families that were in the Resturant. We felt a bit ignored. Ordered two glasses of milk for the kids, one cup was only a bit half full. Also they were tiny cups. As for the food, The eggs Benedict that I ordered was actually pretty good, it had good flavor and the ham that they used under it was actually very tasty. Instead of your traditional muffin that it goes on it was actually put on a croissant. The homemade pancakes that I ordered was only OK nothing special a bit dry. The garden omelette was fine again nothing special just an omelette. We also had the open face sausage egg and cheese which was pretty decent the ham that they used was very good. As a side order we had sausage links which was very overcooked and dry. At the end I was trying to get the attention of the waiter or waitress to bring me the check so we can get going however that took some effort. After asking for the check the check never arrived so I decided to get up and go to the front counter and pay. For some weird reason that took over 10 minutes to do. I waited in front for 5 and went to the restroom and came out and waited some more. I guess it is just a place to see when in the area.",2.0,0
"This a great spot for brunch. We came in with a large group and they were able to accommodate us pretty quickly. The food is fresh and local. The ambiance is super quirky, there are cute antiques all around, every corner is a different experience. Visit the patio the have a fire pit running. This is a place we would definitely visit over and over again.",5.0,1

"Wow...this place is an unexpected treat.  Out in the Berkshires I was in stockbridge and things where just slammed at the few places open on a Tuesday.  So I took to yelp and found pleasant and main and am glad I did.Started off witha cappuccino I ordered the special..and open face ham and cheese melt on a croissant with delicious dill sauce.  Ot came with wonderfully seasoned homefries, a fantastically fresh side salad with a light vinegarete, and some raspberries, blackberries, and bananas.This old time antique or general type store sets an eclectic eatery that should be on your must visit list.I will be back!",5.0,1

"Just had a really negative experience here. Was optimistic going in because of the great reviews but was treated horribly by the staff. As a interracial couple we were ignored and treated neglectfully by the female owner, who eventually said she would check if they had any space (the restaurant was essentially empty). We looked at antiques as we waited another ten minutes only to continue being ignored by both owners. Eventually two young white women walked in and the owner promptly came over, asked if the women if they wanted a table for two, and sat them. We had yet to be seated. We were completely disregarded, disrespected and treated like we didn't exist. We left after this as it was clear that we weren't welcome. Please don't choose to support these bigoted owners who are stuck in the past.",1.0,0
This spot is racist & blatantly rude. They would not sit us as a mixed race couple while there was barely anyone in there eating & then sat two older white women right after while completely ignoring us. Ignorant and stuck in the past .,1.0,0
"Delicious and Enchanting are the words that best describe my 2nd and 3rd visit to Pleasant and Main. Having fulfilled a dream to visit there a year and a half ago, I couldn't wait to return. You won't find personal commitment and heart for fresh ingredients and taste like this anywhere else. Owner, Craig Bero, is one of a kind. Get there asap and tell everyone you know to do the same. Pleasant & Main is now one of my favorite places to visit in New England! It's a hidden gem! Sent from my iPhone",5.0,1
"We were looking forward to a family lunch at this location.  We walked in and were told by a guest at a nearby table that we probably wouldn't be able to get a seat.  That seemed odd since there were only two tables with customers.  A woman came out of the kitchen and told us ""no way"".  We were told that she could not seat us as they were short on help.  She said she would talk to the chef but never returned.  We went outside and walked around to look at the patio area and the antiques.  A gentleman from the kitchen came out, we said hello and he just ignored us.  They need to put a sign out saying they cannot seat people that day. The rude reception was not what we expected.   Very disappointing!",1.0,0
"This restaurant is by far my most favorite restaurant, and I've eaten all over the United States while on one of our many motorcycle trips.  The food and ambiance are Exceptional, and way beyond words. You have to go to  experience it!  We ate there last night with friends. Craig cooked us the most amazing dinner that included salmon, brisket, beef stew and chicken that was over the top!  His cuisine is so diversified!  We ate in the ""barn"" that is open air with fireplaces and old antiques and everything handmade from wood and metals. Little dining nooks..  breathtaking!  You need to experience it and then pass on the good vibes that emanate from the experience!",5.0,1
"This place stole my heart! Craig, the owner, was absolutely wonderful. Nicest restraint owner we've met since dining in this area. We told him it was our first time eating here, and have gave us complimentary orange juice. Our meal was delicious, and left ya happy and satisfied. We were ready to pay our bill, and he brought us a lemon crepe topped with berries and whipped cream ON THE HOUSE. Thanks a million Craig, we'll be back.",5.0,1

"I fell asleep and woke up at Alice in wonderland! Being served coffee in a silver tea pot in a tray with real napkins and antique tea cupThe moment we walked in I knew it was going to be an experience but never thought it could be this amazing. Greg is an awesome host who made us feel like we were home, we never order orange juice but got served juice in an old beautiful champagne fluteFood, omg I can't say enough about the food, We had a side salad dressed with tzatziki sauce next to our eggs that was out of this world. my husband who's not a breakfast person cleaned his plate. Oh and the silver tea pot kept stoping by with fresh coffee every now and then.. and just as we thought it could get any better here comes Greg with this amazing steaming Apple crumble with raspberries  and whipped cream that again we didn't order but he obviously knew we needed it... I can't NOT wait to go back and try supper! Ps; when our check came, we were charged for 2 breakfast and coffee only. What an amazing owner! we are very privileged to have this place so close to our home.",5.0,1
"Loved this gem of a restaurant. Very eclectic interior with beautiful antiques throughout. Our server was very patient and efficient. The owner was there also serving guests and he was very friendly, told us to check out the back garden. Would 100% recommend to anyone in the area",5.0,1
"Our brunch at Pleasant and Main was the highlight of our weekend in the Berkshires. The experience compelled us to write our first Yelp review.Many outdoor seating areas in the era of COVID are tables slapped on sidewalks. The P&M garden best described as a portal into a fantasy realm. I kid you not, friendly chipmunks will nibble sunflower seeds from your hands.Food-wise, imagine classics like the eggs benedict and garden omelet, but made to perfection. Delicious.The staff was friendly and accommodating. Craig, especially, made us feel like part of the community (despite being your classic tourists).We will certainly be back the next time we're in the Berkshires. We'd even consider a trip just to come here again.",5.0,1
Closed out a nice weekend trip from NYC at this true gem of a place. The food was phenomenal and the hospitality even more so. The interior is full of great antiques and unique finds. Craig is a great story teller and an awesome proprietor. 5 stars aren't enough!!,5.0,1

"The most amazing place to eat Thanksgiving dinner and close to Arlo Guthrie's Center. If you are in the area, the owner, Craig, will make you feel so very welcome. A special shout out to the rest of the staff and volunteers who made our visit one of the most memorable Thanksgivings everThank you",5.0,1
"Truly I am only echoing all that has been said by the other 5 star reviewers. Our Berkshire experience lead us this way back to Connecticut as a country ride. Husband and another couple accompanied me. We had no reservations,(didn't know but it should be noted) we were not turned away. Craig, owner/head chef made it work. Like said by all other reviewers, brunch on this Sunday, 5 stars not enough. We learned, call ahead as a reservation in or outside. They will make the experience just right!!",5.0,1
"Food was delicious & service was great. Do not go here for a quick bite, they make delicious homemade food to order. Also, in our case the woman who waited on us also answered the phone, seated us, took our order & was cooking & serving.",5.0,1

"Had a thoroughly UN-pleasant experience here. Service was super scattered, lacking in attentiveness, and impolite on account of what I assume are the two hosts/owners. Several mistakes were made throughout the experience and not much effort was made to redeem them. The young waiter was a little scattered but at least had a pleasant attitude, compared to the hosts. My omelette was totally lacking in flavor and texture. The tasty house-made muffins and relatively peaceful outside seating were the only two redeeming qualities in my experience. The vibe I got is that the hosts/owners are overwhelmed. I was disappointed after hearing good things, but I would not recommend.",2.0,0
"So impressed with the freshness of the ingredients and flavors of everything I had here. Soup and salad may sound plain and boring but the combination here was probably on the top list of best I've ever had. As you can see and read from other reviews, the decor is lovely but I must add that the outdoor patio is also very charming- and from what I understand I was the first to experience the new outdoor kitchen. I also had the pleasure of meeting and speaking with Craig. The entire experience was a pleasant surprise and very enjoyable! Thank you!",5.0,1

We were taking a few days away in the Berkshires during Covid. We were driving around with no particular place to go and literally happened upon Pleasant and Main. The owner Craig made us feel very welcomed and made a few takeout meals for us;  all restaurants were closed and were takeout only. Also enjoyed the antiques and picked up a few  very reasonably priced pieces while we were picking up our take out.,5.0,1
"The bf and I stumbled upon this place after a hike this past weekend. We both had an amazing time on this getaway weekend from the City, but we both agree that our experience at this cafe was by far the highlight of our trip.By the time we had arrived at the cafe, it was clearly off peak hours and might have been closed (?) But the owner, Craig, seeing how tired and hungry we were, let us stay to refuel.He turned on the music, got to chopping away in the kitchen, while we perused the cute wall of knick knacks and admired the very nostalgic and homey furniture. Meanwhile, he prepared us a great lunch of quiche, potato and chicken salads, coffee cakes and hot chocolate and juice. We were beyond happy and full. And afterwards, he invited us to enjoy the backyard outside the little cafe before we headed home, which we happily did.The way that he opened up his cafe to two travelers and clearly had so much joy in making and serving the food was so touching. We were so incredibly thankful for the experience and highly recommend this cafe to anyone staying in the Berkshires.",5.0,1

"Another enchanted evening, and in an extremely safe, super clean, well disinfected and extraordinarily, distance-spaced dining room! (and there are only about exactly 2 establishments in MA these days where I actually feel safe enough to eat indoors during this blasted pandemic...)  Having discovered this jewel of a little restaurant back in the fall, thanks to an excellent article in the Boston Globe (S. Farragher 9-20-20), my husband and I had a fantastic dinner in the lovely outdoor garden/patio, on a warm fall night in October, and we appreciated the delicious food and eclectic and comfortable yet healthy environment so much, that we went back the next morning for a yummy  breakfast, too.  On that visit, the temps were a little cooler, and the outdoor fireplace was a nice touch.Our most recent visit, two weekends ago (January 2021), brought us back for another amazing meal- a multi-course dinner from soup to nuts and everything in between.  Each course was perfect: fresh well seasoned ingredients prepared in an expert manner. Our taste buds were in heaven! Although the patio was looking very inviting then with a festive air of holiday warmth and pretty with trees and lights and the fireplace and all that, we opted to eat indoors.  The interior dining room is large, and the ambience is charming and unique.  Even if you are not a fan of antiques, you can't help but admire the beauty and originality of the furniture, lighting, décor and table settings.  There is a lot of fascinating history here, enough to give you interesting pause, and if you manage to squeeze in a little chat with the owner, well, that's simply a lucky bonus.Importantly, too, guest tables are so far apart from each other that you would have to yell well across the room to another guest just to be heard. There is good ventilation, and the number of staff is small.  It feels like the right place to be. And of course, there's the food, the oh-so-good food.  We have thoroughly loved every single thing we have eaten here.  You just can't go wrong, and we can't wait to go back.  Next time we're in  the Berkshires, we're there!",5.0,1
"Pleasant and Main is a one-of-a-kind restaurant. Really. It's hard to describe. Stepping into the place, one wonders whether they've found an antique shop or a restaurant. The truth is... a bit of both. But the restaurant, of course, is the foundation of what is a truly outstanding experience.I had breakfast (brunch?) here twice, while visiting from out of town. The quality of food here was perfection. Omelets, pancakes, crepes, and French toast are among the foods I tasted, and each one of these dishes exhibited a kind of care and attention to flavor that I haven't seen outside of a few special places in Japan. It's not food that wows with presentation (although the presentation on antique dishes is delightful!), it's not food that impresses with complexity per se (not in the way that some ""modern American"" NY restaurants do, and at fancy NY restaurant prices...) - it's food that's made with love. It feels like you're a personal guest, a personal friend, and you've been given a meal cooked for you and nobody else. I don't want to talk the place up TOO much - of course tastes differ, and you'll have to try it out for yourself. But if you're anywhere close, in the area, not in the area... it's worth the trip. I don't think I've ever gone to the same restaurant twice in one vacation (why wouldn't you try out a variety of other restaurants?), but I was so convinced by the first meal that I just had to come back to try out more of that menu.Finally, a side note: the price is absurdly low. I don't know how they stay in business. It doesn't make sense. Breakfast dishes are in the $8-12 range, and dinner is just a few bucks more. If you eat here, and have the means, please leave a generous tip. I want them to stay in business for a long, long time!",5.0,1
"Wow! We had an incredible brunch here. Surrounded by artifacts and antiques of a time long ago, somehow one feels in the right place and time being here.

"We were hesitant without being able to see the menu decided to give it an adventure on our trip to the Berkshire area. Nothing about this experience was disappointing! The owner/reception/wait staff was the ideal host and made this entire experience one of the best memories of our week long trip. We ordered the pot roast and organic chicken pot pie and both were amazing.  He even offered us seconds but who had room?! While our food was being prepared, we enjoyed looking around at all the antiques that filled every nook and cranny. After dinner, he invited us to go out back and enjoy the outdoor fireplace. We even roasted marshmallows for dessert. It was a wonderful evening and we'll definitely be back on our next trip to the Berkshires.",5.0,1

I was surprised to see a 4 star average rating after my stellar experience. I looked through the reviews and found that all the negative reviews were from people that went during a holiday and were disappointed it was understaffed. This is a very small town and it can be extremely difficult to bring on additional staff just for extremely busy days that happen very few times per year. Love this place and will definitely come back whenever we are in town!",5.0,1

I recommend this to any local or someone visiting the Berkshires.",5.0,1

"We had a singularly unpleasant experience in the Pleasant Cafe.  As people of color and LGBTQ, we were met with a distinct feeling of ""you're not welcome here."" The sign greeting dinners at the door read ""seat yourself"" but I gather that didn't apply to us.  We were asked twice by the silver-haired proprietor if we had a reservation (the place was half empty and nothing online recommended making a reservation.) When we politely replied no, she abruptly turned her back and walked away, leaving us in a liminal space, and stared at by the entire restaurant. When the young server tried to set a table for us the nasty greeter snapped at her apparently the empty table was intended for a wedding party. We were made to feel as if we were inconveniencing the staff. It was humiliating. Rude and racist. Avoid!",1.0,0

"I've been here once before and remembered it for its eclectic decor. I thought it would be fun to take a visitor there for New Year's Day. I can only guess this wasn't the regular staff, but I felt frustrated with the one over-taxed server and her helper. The coffee was cold, the menu was confused, and the eggs on my Florentine were borderline raw. I'd suggest just not opening when you don't have a regular staff available. It wasn't really all that busy, honestly (5 tables and staggered), but the staff was a mess. I so want to love this place, but I just can't.[note: I just noticed the 56 reviews that were ""unpublished"" by Yelp. I wish I'd seen them before we went. They are accurate and we had the same experience. Guess it wasn't the holiday staff after all.]",2.0,0
This friendly cafe is a must when in the Berkshires. We enjoyed a phenomenal dinner prior to our concert at Tanglewood. We had the bbq maple pulled pork and the pot roast. It was absolutely delicious. We ate in the beautiful garden out back which has lovely views.,5.0,1
"Very nice place.  Comfortable and eclectic.  Lots of fun things to look at while you dine...antiques, books, etc.  The food was delicious.  Unfortunately, we caught them at the tail end of a big lunch rush and the wait staff was a bit harried.  I ordered a turkey club and was served turkey pot pie (which was really yummy if unexpected).  The only thing that really bugged me (and this is minor) is the ""please seat yourself"" sign. That can have negative effects when the wait staff is overtaxed, like they were on this occasion.  You don't always get noticed, so you end up sitting for a while before getting service.",3.0,0

"Pleasant and Main, more like Mediocre and Secondary. Felt like an antique store that decided to serve food for the day. Our waitress was aloof and cold, she wasn't familiar with the menu and didn't know what earl grey tea was. Silverware was awkwardly given to us by a second waitress who seemed very scared. We weren't given water, coffee was full of grounds and practically undrinkable. When asking for a second glass of orange juice the waitress returned ten minutes later saying they ran out. Brunch on a Sunday. Was never given the side of sausage we ordered. Poached eggs were cooked hard. The potatoes were fantastic but scarce.",1.0,0

"Easily one of the worst dining experiences in a long time. Went with family (7) at 1:30 on a Saturday and place was emp tee which in this area is unheard of but should have been a sign to turn around. Table wasn't set and after five minutes the waitress came with napkins and put those out. Five minutes later she came with cutlery and piled it on the table for us to distribute. Finally five minutes after that she came with menus. Really?!?OMG food was bad. Burgers were too salty. Salad was drowned with dressing. Ran out of fries but didn't tell us just didn't serve them. Spilled drinks, lack of ketchup and just nothing but nothing worth the $18/person bill. And finally the waitress - didn't speak English, didn't take the correct order, didn't set up the table, didn't know how to use the credit machine and was easily the worst service in all the Berkshires. Sad place. Avoid at all cost.",1.0,0
"I was amazed at the quality of the food as much as I was the eclectic furnishings of this place.

Special condiments also included.The following evening, I had dinner. Outstanding food. With a changing dinner menu, you choose from the fresh menu. I had a French pesant veal dish, cucumber salad with Apple Crisp. Whoa! Outstanding!Heavenly gourmet is the best description I can find.Looking for a hidden gem, find this place and eat here!

"un·ex·pect·ed/nkspektd/adjectivenot expected or regarded as likely to happenWhen you've been around the block as much as I have it is difficult to surprise me. This is especially true in The Berkshires where for the most part things remain sedate and stable. Last night at Pleasant and Main was a rare, Berkshire-specific surprise. From the moment you enter you wonder if you are in a restaurant, an antique store, or a family member's attic. The place is choc-a-bloc with mementos and chachkies all sensitively and artfully displayed to create an ambiance unlike any other. I felt at home and yet strangely immersed into another world. Other reviewers have described it as eccentric and I would agree. Now, the question for you is if you like eccentric as I do.Ambiance is only part of any good dining experience. Service and food have to deliver and last night both did in spades. We were welcomed like regulars even though this was our first time and surprised with delicious bites from the moment we sat down. I'm writing this review having just relived some of the flavors from their succulent pot roast transformed this morning into sweet potato hash with dropped eggs and toasted croissant. Yes, Pleasant and Main gave us not one but two enjoyable meals and we know there will be more in the future.TIP:  Please note that there is no liquor license currently so prepare yourself and your dining partners accordingly.",5.0,1

He made us a DELICIOUS surprise meal which consisted of fruit, toasted fluffy croissants with homemade raspberry jam, half of an eggs bene, omelette, sautéed greens, french toast, ham, bacon, and great coffee.

"This place was amazing, in both ambiance and food, though it took a few minutes for us to fully appreciate it. Our table was brought free grilled orange bread left over from the holidays and it was spectacular. The eggs were  delicious, but be sure to read the menu online as there is more to order from than what is on the small paper one they bring you. Very sweet staff. Can't wait to visit again. Hidden gem.",5.0,1
A very cute cafe with great customer service and breakfast. We ordered the farmers omelet and the French toast. We also had orange juice which tasted so fresh and croissants with jelly and butter. The French toast had a fruit spread which was delicious and the jelly for the croissants tasted incredible! The omelet was served with potatoes and a salad which was also great! The man who runs it is very nice and very attentive to the customers. Would definitely recommend!!,5.0,1
The owner of this cute place is a really generous  host--the ambiance is unique----check it out!,5.0,1
"Wow!! This place is extraordinary! I walked inside and they had delicious sweets out on the foyer table. The inside is so charming that it felt like being in a movie... I can't wait to come back. It's definitely a hidden gem with the best ambiance that I've seen anywhere!!! There's stained glass, lots of wood paneling, leather couches, and the whole perimeter is surrounded by tasteful antiques such as china and antique cookie cutters. And the owner was so nice!! He picked up two pastures, put them in a bag and handed them to me. I've never had a proprietor hand me free food like that before. I think that I'm going to have to become a regular at this place.",5.0,1
"Another magical dinner at Pleasant & Main last Friday! I made reservations for 8 earlier in the week before a weekend bicycle tour through the Berkshires I'd planned, and we arrived to a beautifully set table with fresh flowers. After a delicious meal of salmon pasta, trout salad, and fried chicken, Craig surprised us with a show-stopping s'mores crepe and a bowl of cherries. We love you Craig!",5.0,1
"Pleasant and Main is as good as it gets! Most certainly a hidden gem in the Berkshires, you will be so happy you stopped in for delicious local eats, lovely company, beautiful rustic decor, and, of course, the owner's unmatched hospitality. My fiance and I stumbled upon this place on a cross-country move back to Boston. Craig served us a wonderful beet, egg and chicken salad, chicken soup, shepherd's pie, an ice cream sundae, and a slice of berry pie. Then cappuccinos to top it all off! All of it was outstanding. We mentioned that we were getting married and he proceeded to help us plan our wedding. He is truly a renaissance man and such a fun conversationalist.We returned about a month later to see a Tanglewood concert, ordering cod, meat loaf, a strawberry crepe, and a rhubarb crumble. It was all delicious, as per usual, and we got an extra special side of lobster roll on the house! This place is magical. It's a must for anyone traveling through the Berkshires.",5.0,1
"While driving around we found this gem. Amazing food, staff and atmosphere. The owner and staff were welcoming and accommodating. Definitely coming back to this place!",5.0,1
"Father's Day was my third visit. We were greeted by a server who was clearly in the weeds, not with a hello but I'll be with you in a while I am alone and very busy.  After 10 minutes we left.  The food previously was very good but service is not their strong suit.",2.0,0
"Where do I begin? I am thrilled to have found this unusual restaurant/ antique store! First, I must say that the food is delicious and beautifully presented. We had the chicken salad and it was chock full of FRESH veggies and fruit over lettuce. Broccoli, carrots, cranberries, tomatoes, cauliflower, raspberries and apple slices over the fresh cut chicken pieces! And the dressing was simple yet amazing!    The ambience is eclectic yet with an old fashioned feel... like we were visiting in a friend's home. We met the chef, Craig, who makes this haven his life as this is his art and his love. And it shows!",5.0,1
"Imagine entering a time machine and going back to the 1920's to rural New England. Spirits would be running high with no hint of a great depression in sight. Americans would be feeling united after WWI and not indulging in divisive liberals versus conservative rhetoric. The dining experience would probably include strolling (not driving) to the local inn where the owner's smile and the chatter of diner would greet you when you walked in. The food would be simple but made using the freshest of ingredients sourced locally, eggs and vegetables straight from the farm and warm baked bread. The owner would have his heart in his business, taking the time to get to know the guests, doing the rounds making chit chat about the weather, politics and local gossip. One would eat and chat to one's heart's content and leave feeling nourished and mentally rejuvenated. The furniture would be handmade and handpicked by the owner; antique by today's standards... I could go on. Entering Pleasant And Main is like having  a surge of authenticity injected into the bloodstream. It's an antique store (all items are for sale) that happens to serve wonderful food. To us it was an authentic shot in the arm and much needed antidote to a life predominated by smartphones, e-commerce and social media as a surrogate for ahuman connection. We have dined here for breakfast and dinner each time choosing a unique table and seeing a different corner stacked with a paraphernalia of antique knick knacks and books. The restaurant serve a mean stack of pancakes and French crepes, and delicious omelettes accompanied with fresh ground bean based coffee. Dinner includes a choice of three terrific mains, trout or perch from the lakes in the area, quality meat and much much more.",5.0,1
"This was the best dinner I've ever had in my life. My boyfriend and I called to see if Craig (the owner) was taking reservations on a very cold winter evening, and even though he said he wasn't planning on it due to the unlikely event anyone would show up on such a severely cold night, he offered to seat us if we came early enough. What happened next was the most magical evening ever. It was just myself, my boyfriend, and Craig for a couple hours. Craig brought us fabulous food of epic proportions (highly recommend the Turkey pot pie and salmon tortellini) and told us stories about the restaurant and his life. He even lit a fire in the backyard so that we could go take a peek at the snow-covered spectacle that is his space. Honestly the sweetest man with the most beautiful stories I've ever heard. Please please please go check out Pleasant and Main. You'll be supporting a worthy establishment and have the best food and experience of your life. We also left with framed photographs and prints that will take center stage in our apartments. Stop here and you'll find something so amazing!",5.0,1
"We came here for breakfast. The place itself is very eclectic, a little bit of everything, it's like antique shop and a restaurant both.We had farmer's omelette, pancakes with seasonal fruit and a Nutella and banana crepe. The omelette was the best, full of flavor. However, the presentation left much to be desired. It was all broken up and looked like something cooked by a culinary institute trainee.The pancakes were cold. The seasonal fruit they were supposed to be served with consisted of a raspberry, a blackberry and 3 pieces of banana.The crepe also came out cold. There was so little Nutella on it (maybe they were scraping the bottom of the jar!) and again, 3 slices of banana.Luckily for us we are on vacation and would not be returning to this place.Note for the owner!!! The antiques could be beautiful and very eclectic. However, when they are mixed with cobwebs it just makes one go ewww. Clean up your place! Especially if you are serving food.",3.0,0
"What a treat this was.  If you haven't been,its worth the trip from anywhere!  The restaurant is cozy...full of antiques and beautiful crystal and china. There is a huge stained glass window hanging in the center of the room. Right from the time we stepped in we felt so welcomed. Our brunch was wonderful...beautifully presented...almost too pretty to eat. A plate of fresh fruit,french toast and the best scrambled eggs I have had. among other things.The waiter was very attentive. There is so much to look at, you could spend time just wandering around enjoying the surroundings. There is a lovely garden/dining area outside also. We are looking forward to returning to this very pleasant restaurant again soon.",5.0,1
"Five+ stars from an extremely tough judge. Everything was done above and beyond expectations. Our only option was a to-go dinner (given covid-19); we were offered 2 delicious mushroom soups followed by 'texas-size' portions of wild caught salmon + pork chops + a dessert.. Instead of plastic containers, Craig's staff brought the generous portions using real heavy plates (honor system to return them as soon as convenient). We asked how much our total was..and the young gentlemen said 12 dollars per person. Just the delic soup alone should have had a 12-usd tag. Perfectly sauteed greens (incl wild locally grown), my wife was happy. The restaurant is clearly not after making money during this hard time, the goal must be to offer an amazing meal everyone can afford, especially the ones who got hurt due to the virus. I would suggest that the more  fortunate ones should probably consider leaving a bit more than 12 dollars per person as the place doesn't seem to be cutting corners on the quality of the ingredients (maybe 20). Seems like organic + locally grown produce.. I am not a big review person (in fact, this is my first ever), I just couldn't help it. Best of luck to PnM and many thanks for what you are doing for the local community.",5.0,1
"Absolutely amazing Craig is an NYC transplant who has taking his artistic style and delicious food to this small town USA. So happy to have found this jewel wish I lived closer to visit more often. The decor is that of a 50's general store meets antique shop. Went there with my to young children who Craig greater with a complimentary hot chocolate with whip cream on top, yum. I had the open faces croissant with ham and Gruyere, so good. Highly recommended must go.",5.0,1
"This place is awesome! Craig is a wonderful host who thought of everything we might want and then some. The decor is eclectic and charming, full of lovingly curated knick-knacks and furniture, including a bar rescued from Trump Tower, a New York subway grate made into a table, a treehouse and an old wood burning stove outside. Craig will regale you with stories of Greenwich Village before and after 9/11. He loves kids and my nieces had a great time exploring and playing server for a little while. For community supper, he just kept bringing out delicious courses one after the other, and he makes a mean espresso. The price can't be beat either! Worth a special trip!!",5.0,1
"Such a magical restaurant.  I genuinely and sincerely pity the people who miss out on dining here because it has no liquor license.  Have a drink at home, and enjoy the best restaurant in the southern Berkshires.  No restaurant in Great Barrington compares.  The time and care spent decorating are obvious, and very appreciated.  SO nice when a restaurant owner makes the effort to create a unique atmosphere (so few do).The food was delicious, and plentiful without being overwhelming.  My pasta with lobster in a cream sauce included just about a whole lobster, and the sauce was not heavy, and the flavors rolled over your taste buds.For me, nice bread is a critical start to dining out, and this night they had delicious toasty Italian bread, that made me wish I had room in my stomach for more.",5.0,1
"We were immediately enchanted by Pleasant and Main and now return again and again...each time both our tummies and spirits are amply fed by the wonderful chef-proprietor Craig, who harvests his ultra fresh produce from local farms, trails and waterways. Delicious food, unbeatable ambiance, terrific for families, antique-lovers, for quick or leisurely bites. Not to be missed!!",5.0,1
"A nice change-of-pace place, I think it's an old general store that was remade into a restaurant. Lots of old ""store"" items on the shelves lining the dining room to add some atmosphere. It looks like Breakfast and Lunch are their main meals but the dinner choices were pretty good. We ordered dinner and they brought out some soup before the meal (didn't notice it listed on the menu but it was good). Dinner was fresh and well prepared. After dinner I was going to have the cheesecake but was pretty full from the earlier meal so passed, maybe next time. After paying the check, they brought over some hot chocolate which was nice as it was a bit chilly that evening and it was free.",4.0,1
"Pleasant and Main is a great option if you're looking for something a little different. We stopped here for dinner and found the experience very Pleasant indeed.The waitstaff was very attentive and prompt. We had gone a few months ago and found the food to be good but the service a little slow. That was not the case this time. While we were waiting for our dinner they first brought out rolls, then a plate of deviled eggs, and finally a lightly pickled cucumber dish that was delicious. Each dish available on the community dinner menu was explained to us in detail, and we all were pleased with our choice. This is definitely a restaurant we will be returning to.",5.0,1
"We stopped in for brunch one Saturday.The decor is really amazing.It's an old general store full of nostalgic pieces as well as some  decorative items as well. An eclectic collection.I had the turkey club...not a true club per say...it was served on two slices of toast...not triple stacked...made with local very fresh ingredients...smallsides included home fries, salad and raisin bread pudding.The home made iced tea was great.My wife had ham steak and home fries.Two small steaks very well presented.Her coffee was very good.We skipped dessert.",4.0,1
"UPDATE: We visited P&M for our fourth time over the weekend and the food was delicious, as usual.  I ordered pasta with smoked salmon marinara sauce and a beet and citrus salad.  So yummy!  I wish I could have ordered a glass of wine, but no liquor license yet.  Craig more than made up for it with his generosity.  We especially loved the revamped ""ice fishing hut"" he created on the patio.  Each detail displayed his incredible sense of style and design.  It was fun to introduce our friends to this place.  We're looking forward to our next visit!  ORIGINAL REVIEW: This restaurant is the BEST place I've been in ages.  Back in May 2015, we got lost traveling from Ohio to Boston and ended up here.  We were treated like queens and haven't stopped talking about it since.  A recent visit confirmed our love for Craig and his incredible hospitality.  And the food!  Everything we've tried has been amazing.  Favorites include: the strawberry white chocolate crepe and a delicious dish of cod with caper lemon sauce.  We especially appreciate that all the ingredients are locally sourced.  We love this place so much that we've recommended this restaurant to all our Boston friends.  We can't wait to come back!",5.0,1

"Probably one of the strangest breakfast restaurant experiences I have ever had. Eclectic decor and vintage furnishings made the ambiance unique. My favorite part of my meal was probably the croissant and the coffee. The omelet was just okay, but I did appreciate the small little salad that accompanied the meal. Service was pleasant and everyone was very friendly. The don't open until 8:30 am, and even that is flexible as we arrived at 8:35 am and the doors were still locked. Would consider going back to try their community supper.",3.0,0
"Looking to treat myself to a late breakfast on a mid-winter Sunday, stopped in at Pleasant and Main which I had been meaning to try for a while. Pleasant and Main is, as it's named, at the intersection of Pleasant and Main in the heart of Housatonic, a bit off the beaten path if you are in the larger towns of the Berkshires.  I'd say it is worth the detour.The place is a combo of restaurant and antique shop where they tell you ""everything is for sale"".  I'm not big on antiquing so for me it was decor which was very ""pleasant"".As for the food, I selected the open croissant topped with gruyere cheese, country ham and scrambled eggs. Very nice and a right-sized portion.  It was served with a small green salad on the plate which gave it more of a brunchy feel.  Coffee was good as well.Service was good and, overall, it was a very pleasant experience.  OK. Enough with the pleasantries.",4.0,1
"I was pleasantly wowed and shocked. This place is why I love the Berkshires. Our waitress, Nancy, was very attentive, friendly, and every course was delicious! The salad & lobster bisque was like a circus in my mouth, the chicken was out of this world, and the dessert showed me a whole new potential for a baked peach. Not to mention the fun atmosphere, and even the owner, Craig, stopped by to say hello. We were stunned by how Nancy would occasionally surprise us with a special something that Craig has made. Thank you so much, can't wait to return.",5.0,1
"Very slow service, dirty dishes, no silver wear was provided until after we got our food so we could not  doctor up our coffee, no water was ever brought to the table after we asked a couple of times, order was brought out wrong and the food was disappointing.  The crepe with eggs and ham was a mess, French toast was with store bought sliced bread.  Very cool interior but not much other than that.",1.0,0
"What a delight! Found this spot via Yelp while on the road. It was so cozy and the food was fabulous on a rainy, Massachusetts morning. Had the open faced egg and ham croissant. Absolutely delish! My mother truly enjoyed her farmer's market omelette, as well as the eclectic decor! Stop in for sure! Chef even came out and asked if we wanted seconds! So sweet",5.0,1
"This place is a gem!  Craig Bero, owner of Pleasant and Main, is a veteran restaurateur with a star spangled history.  If your from NYC and remember Anglers and Writers or the Bespeckled Trout then you have an inkling of what your in for here. We come up from Brooklyn as often as we can to get some of Craig's delicious and flavorful farm to table food. Brunch is always visually pleasing and gastronomically satisfying here, today we had eggs Norwegien with roasted home fried potatoes and a pleasing side salad.  It's not a place to come when your in a rush, service can be spotty,  but the food is superb and worth slowing down for. Once I had the good fortune of arriving on a day Craig had venison stew.  I will not soon forget the savory balance of flavors, one of the best meals I can recall. While you wait browse the shop.  When you find something you like talk to Craig, if he's willing to part with the item he's sure to give you a fair price. There is also a little backyard oasis to explore. We missed it this time around,  but we'll be back soon to warm our hands over the fire and eat sweet crepes with fresh berries. I am also hoping to return for one of the community dinners. Make Pleasant and Main a stop when your in the Berkshires. You'll be glad you did it's a special place with delicious food and a community focus.",5.0,1
"Wow, love this place!  After decades of running multiple restaurants in New York City, Craig moved to the Berkshires and established another fabulous cafe - and we finally found him!  Six different breakfasts were all excellent, including the fresh fruit muffins, chocolate croissant, open face breakfast croissant, veggie omelette with goat cheese, the scrumptious New England sampler platter, oatmeal w/ local raspberries, and an amazing gluten-free Nutella crepe!  Haven't tried dinner yet, but intend to soon. Importantly, Jen and Nick were both thoughtful, attentive servers. Highly recommend.",5.0,1
"Amazing experience, hospitality and of course the food.  The chef/owner (Craig) was very giving and made sure we had a great experience.  His restaurant has so much character, it's just wonderful.

"We've come to the Berkshire on vacation for years. We like to try new places to dine. Pleasant and Main was todays new place.  Don't let the window construction deter you from experiencing the fabulous and leisurely  dining delight.  Started with a tasty hot soup and ended with the best hot chocolate of my life.

The owner also told us that he and his staff would soon be serving pris fixee dinner, too, on the weekends.We rolled in around noon for omelets and cappuccino.  Goat cheese and spinach came in a fluffy and steaming pillow of well-seasoned eggs, and the coffee was NYC-quality... without NYC-pretension. My boyfriend had a clementine and blood orange crepe with local maple syrup.  All delicious! The service was casual but professional, attentive and prompt.   And the decor--a strange but appealing mixture of antiques and fishing memorabilia --was tasteful and interesting. Finally, the prices were very reasonable --some of the best we've seen in the area.  We'll definitely be coming back, often!",5.0,1
"We were really excited to have brunch here. I called to make a reservation a week in advance, but when we arrived they had no record of our reservation. There appeared to be only one server for the whole restaurant, and he told us we would have to wait at least 30 minutes, even though there were several open tables. He also said several of the staff did not come in that day, and that we should probably go to another restaurant. As a couple was leaving the restaurant they told us ""good luck"". So we left.",1.0,0

"How much do I love this place?I came yesterday for breakfast ( the omelette is to die for), supper, and again tonight, my final night in the area for an amazing supper.There is nothing negative to write. A true jewel that would be mobbed 24/7 if located in, say, Great Barrington. However, being in Housatonic, just 8 min drive from there, it seems overlooked.But not for long.Once people discover this place I predict it will be gangbusters. The owner is a sweetheart who bends over backwards to take care of you. Abundant free parking. Fantastic decor in a 19th century ambiance. And the food is truly great. I got the fish fry tonight which, though not on the menu, the owner made for me. It was scrumptious!The veggies are all local and so tasty.On and on. Just come and you will come back with your friends.What more can I possibly say.",5.0,1
"My wife Ashlee and I came to the Berkshires for our honeymoon and on the final night went to Pleasant and Main, on the hunt for a hot chocolate, which had been featured in the Berkshire Magazine. The owner, Craig Bero did not disappoint. Pleasant and Main is somewhat off the beaten path in Great Barrington / Housatonic area, but it is worth whatever drive it takes you to get there. Craig not only brought out an impressive hot chocolate that was as advertised, but a delicious raspberry and chocolate crepe. He also brought us persecco with raspberries after hearing we were recently married. We also found out that Pleasant and Main does not only make the world's best hot chocolate and crepes, but has a great menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Craig has a very talented chef and they have been working together for years, including several cafes in NYC, who we also met after raving about the food we ate. If you are looking for great food in a unique, cozy place, Pleasant and Main is it. Tell Craig that Matt and Ashlee sent you!!",5.0,1

We have been here before for breakfast and lunch.  Nice to realize that dinner is as appetizing as the early day fare. We look forward to returning for community supper.

Stopped by with a group of families for dinner here last Tuesday night while on a ski trip to Ski Butternut. It was a fantastic experience and Craig (the owner) was extremely welcoming and accommodating with such a large group. The food was on point and delicious and he even provided entertainment for the kids (roasting marshmallows in the wood fire oven in the back cabin). Even got to help out making crepes...I could probably go on for a bit but suffice to say this place is awesome and I hope to come back here very soon!,5.0,1

"Had the good fortune to discover this place for lunch. Can't wait to return. It's our new favorite dining spot.The atmosphere is casual eclectic. The decor has a ""general store"" feel, but isn't at all cluttered. Antiques line the walls. All are for sale. You need to inquire of the owner for the price. While there, the occasional diner wandered quietly about, gazing up at the shelves or the the 2 beautiful canoes suspended from the ceiling, one from 1907 (I think I overheard). A small bouquet on each table and bowls with narcissus on some larger tables. The walls a deep, Colonial red which, combined with the warm wood tones and the numerous antiques, create a soothing, comfortable atmosphere.Tables are sufficiently spaced for some privacy. Chairs comfortable. The wide windows at the front allow plenty of light without glare. One very nice thing is that it's quiet. Although it's an open room, there's no hollow echo, no voices bouncing off the walls or each other. Very comfortable for people with hearing aids. Only low volume music and the occasional very low hum of voices in conversation. So pleasant.Despite the negative comments about the service, we thought it fine. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Our waitress informed us that she was a last minute substitute, helping out because the regular waitress was ill that day. Although she obviously wasn't familiar with locations and procedures (we overheard the owner providing instructions) she was kind, interested in making us comfortable and tried hard. The owner is a tall spare gentleman of middle age, sporting jeans, flannel shirt and watch cap, with the lean look, gravelly voice and somewhat breviloquent manner of a born Vermonter. Hard to believe that he's from Manhattan!  But he, too, was attentive and informative. I was bemused by earlier reviews that made unflattering references to his ripped jeans. His attire fit right in with the designer - rustic feel of the space.I mention this only because some reviews complained about the service. We had no such complaints.Both ambience and service were lovely brackets for the best feature - the food. Not exotic. More described as sophisticated home cooking done very well. We had a beef stew and an open faced turkey sandwich with stuffing and potatoes. Both excellent. The beef stew was lean and melted in the mouth with an undercurrent flavor of red wine. Surprisingly, it was all beef and without vegetables, except for a large dollop of creamy and very buttery mashed potatoes on top, broiled. It was not only filling, it was a fitting comfort food for a cold day. The open faced turkey was, I am told, equally delicious. Turkey breast on sourdough bread (from the Berkshire Mountain Bakery, we were told) with gravy. Nice. And encircling it, another mound of those buttery potatoes with a drizzle of some divine, deep sauce. A bit of salad with a light citrusy dressing, a scoop of maple and nut enhanced stuffing (just wonderful) and a melt in your mouth piece of sweet potato with a maple glaze. Much to our surprise, when removing our well cleaned plates, our server asked if we'd like a little more. Offering seconds is standard practice, it appears. We had to refuse. There were sweet crepes on the menu...And oh those crepes! We shared a lemon and a raspberry/chocolate. Light, fluffy crepes. The fresh raspberries were perfectly complemented by just the right amount of chocolate and a swirl of whipped cream on the side. The lemon was spread with a sauce that had just enough sweetness to keep one from puckering and was perfectly, intensely lemony. Couldn't get any better. Oh, and the crepes, as well as the pancakes, can be made gluten free. A welcome discovery, as we have family and friends with gluten intolerance. Our coffee was quite good, strong and not bitter. One reviewer complained about the small size of the cup. Not at all. A diner cup usually holds 6-8 ounces.  Ours, and the other cups  that passed our table, were served in stemmed, clear glass mugs. They definitely held a full cup. In fact, the added height and narrowness keeps the coffee hotter longer, because there's less surface area for it to cool. They did top off our cups. Milk is added by the person making the coffee, which at first concerned me. But, it's steamed when added. As a coffee drinker who only uses cream, I was happy with it.Finally, the value was excellent. Moderate pricing (especially for this area!). We've eaten in many other restaurants in which the food was delicious, but the portions far smaller and the prices far higher. In brief conversations with servers and one patron who was obviously a regular, we learned that this restaurant sources as much of its produce as possible from local, organic farms (although the menu doesn't advertise this). They're awaiting their license to serve wine and beer. This was a thoroughly enjoyable meal for us and we look forward to returning regularly",5.0,1
"Regarding the review by Joselin L.I was a member of her party... the one who had the savory (spinach & goat cheese crepe) which I enjoyed.The experience began with GREAT PROMISE (with the exception of the server requiring an inordinate amount of time to take each order) We were given a gratis small loaf of a ""just from the oven"" banana bread with cherries on top that was beautiful gooey goodness. Then when the owner, Craig, was talking to us & mentioned ""wild watercress"", he pulled out his phone to show us a picture of the frozen ground where he had picked it at 5 am. We were all impressed & thought we were in for a great brunch.The rest of the experience was exactly as Joselin described in her review. The absurd amount of time it took to get the check while listening to a perpetually skipping CD was torture. I, finally, got up to see if I could help expedite the check to see that it was hand written on pieces of torn paper & was ready except for adding the tax. This poor guy (the server) was ill equipped even though at this point, we are, practically, the only ones left in the restaurant. Compassion for his only having 1 week's experience runs out & patience exhausted when forced to listen to a skipping CD on top of a mostly inedible meal for the rest of my party.It was likened to being stuck in a Twilight Zone version of Hell.Craig was a delight & I wish him the best in solving the problems that his restaurant might live up to his vision.UPDATE: For some reason, I can no longer see the review by Joselin L. which is referenced in my review.Here is that which she wrote:""I don't know where to begin, this experience was so bad. The server might have been special needs. It's okay if he was - he had only been there a week, but he was easily the worst sever in the history of food service. I don't understand why no one helped him because he was in way over his head. He took two minutes per person just to write down our orders. The food was terrible. Quiche had raw crust and was more of a gross scramble. All the eggs Benedict orders had overcooked eggs and the hollandaise was broken. The one person with a savory crepe enjoyed hers. The cd's kept skipping. 10 minutes 20 minutes of just annoying skipping with no one responding. The coffee came slowly. One cup per person at a time. No waters even though we kept asking. This is like a teenager's restaurant with no health inspectors. Gross. Go someplace else!!""",1.0,0
"Great breakfast. I had french toast with berries and real maple syrup, and my husband had pancakes.  When we heard that the berries had just been picked, he asked for some on his pancakes as well.  We also had a sides of bacon & country sausage.  All of it was delicious.  The place is filled with country antiques (toys, jars, etc)  which are all interesting to look at.  A feast for the eyes as well as the mouth.",4.0,1
"This place is amazing. It's not just the food, which is terrific, it's about the whole experience. I've been here in January and on a perfect summer night. Each time the owner kept surprising us with tempting, unexpected dishes above and beyond what we had ordered. This week I was among a group of six. Every one of us loved our meals: several had the salmon, one had roasted chicken, and in my case,  pot roast. It was the best pot roast I've ever had both in taste and falling- apart texture. Yes, this place is off the beaten path but definitely worth finding. If for some reason they are having an off night, don't give up. Go again. This place is a jewel.",5.0,1

"I really wish I could like this place, as my family enjoys coming here when we visit.  Though the atmosphere is quaint yet quirky and the owner kind, the food and service have been mediocre the few times I have been. Our Thanksgiving dinner experience yesterday was a huge disappointment.  The servers were absent and inattentive and our meals came out at different times and temperatures.  My turkey was lukewarm and dry, and the squash was barely edible.  Dessert consisted of a teeny tiny square of something pumpkin, no traditional pie as you would expect.  On another trip here last year, service was slow & I was served undercooked chicken on my salad. I know most of the reviews on here have been positive, but I also see many similar to mine.  I do hope they can turn things around if I come here again!",2.0,0
"Pleasant and Main.  The rebirth of a wonderful old factory town building. Now one of the most interesting restaurants in the area. Unique and delicious breakfast, crepes  and always changing dinners. Served in a beautifully eclectic atmosphere by a competent and friendly staff. This mornings fun; engineered by JoEllen, was the challah French toast with fresh raspberries, strawberries, blueberries and banannas. A perfect way to start a summer Sunday. A place not to be ignored.",5.0,1
"I am disappointed to write this review since from the street & reviews on here it looked so promising. Upon entering at 10:45 we discovered the breakfast rush mess had not been cleared from more than half the tables. Every two top except for the one pushed up against a dusty hostess stand was piled with dishes (including all those by the windows) but we were supposed to 'seat ourselves.' That should have been a hint for us to run, but nevertheless we persisted. The watery and flavorless coffee that came first was absolutely awful, among the worst I've ever had anywhere, on par with a gas station. I could not bear to drink it. My husband's mug had bright red lipstick on BOTH sides--there is no way the server could have missed it -- a sign of the lack of care you'll find here. We hoped to find something redeeming in the food but the only thing I can compliment is the salad garnish next to my omelette. It and the vegetables inside (clearly frozen) were cooked beyond edibility--like a yellow kitchen sponge. Probably microwaved. I am so suspicious of the four star and five star reviews on here. They must be fake.  This place is flat out gross.",1.0,0
Was welcomed immediately upon arrival. The food was cooked to order with the freshest ingredients atmosphere was Charming the food was delicious from soup to dessert.

"What a welcome addition to Housatonic! Food, service, and decor are on par with other fine restaurants in the Berkshires, but entirely without pretention. We had breakfast crepes, which were delicious, but friends also passed on high praise for dinner fare, particularly the fish stuffed with crab. While the owner and his chef bring with them years of NYC experience, they are now true members of the local community, cultivating not only the weekend crowd, but reaching out to their neighbors in an authentically caring manner. The result: growing loyalty that will ensure a lasting place for this charming establishment!",5.0,1
"We read all the wonderful reviews of Pleasant and Main and decided to go for breakfast ...I had the Farmer's Market Omelette and my husband had  Eggs Benedict ...both were well prepared with the freshest ingredients. The breakfast potatoes were deliciously flavored with just the right amount of spices and herbs. We chatted with Craig the owner , who was warm and friendly. His restaurant is more like an eclectic antique shop....worth taking the time to peruse while waiting for our food. He invited us to check out his back patio after finishing our meal. It was a uniquely inviting space , complete with two rocking chairs . To complete our amazing meal Craig very kindly sent over the most delicious plate of yummy crepes and the best hot chocolate I've ever had!! A must if you decide to visit this adorable little cafe! Highly recommend making the trip( a bit off the beaten path.... but well worth it)",5.0,1
"We always enjoy our meals at this restaurant. The ingredients are fresh, the meals are tasty, and the service is pleasant. The reason for 4 stars vs 5 is that the chef uses a bit too much salt for our taste, but we still enjoy the home-cooked flavors. Bring a sweater as the dining room is large and often a bit cooler than comfortable.",4.0,1
"Heard great things about this quaint cafe so had to try it. My friend and I made the drive from Northampton for lunch this past weekend. Filled with interesting antiques and nostalgic items. Fun to walk through. Eating was a totally different experience. The service was absolutely horrible. We were told to seat ourselves I think by the owner. He had 2 young women waitressing and for the 3 tables occupied we all should have had great service. But not so. We almost got our own menus but finally they came. We then asked for water with lemon...after another long wait we got water and was told lemons would be coming soon. My friend ordered the farmers omelette with no peppers, extra spinach. Well, she didn't get any spinach, asparagus instead, and peppers! Oh and the side of toast was served halfway through the meal. (We heard the table next to us asking for their toast too as they were also almost done)I ordered soup first then salad with dressing on the side. Got both at the same time and dressing on the salad--they used way too much!  I asked if they could redo and this time if I could have soup first as I ordered. Well, I ended up eating alone because it took so long. All we wanted was to finish up and leave...waited and waited for someone to give us a check. Finally we were sick of waiting. Left cash on the table based on the menu prices/tax and left. Wouldn't go back because of the service and errors in food. If they showed some interest after messing up the order, maybe...but not after ignoring us.",2.0,0
"Pleasant and Main is a real hidden gem in an unexpected setting.  The food was exceptionally well prepared.  We enjoyed a wonderful dinner that rivaled any high end urban restaurant.  Craig is a great one man show - warm, talented and generous in addition to being a fabulous chef.  I understand that in the past he owned a restaurant in NYC across from the World Trade Center.  Western Mass is lucky he chose to relocate.   Highly recommend that anyone looking for a fresh experience stop in for a meal and visit - this is not your run of the mill restaurant!",5.0,1
"I cannot comment on the food here because when I asked if they could adapt anything on the menu to be vegan, the waitress said ""you are on your own,"" and offered no suggestions.  During our time their (the rest of my family (not vegans) seemed to enjoy their food, and I observed the absolutely rude waitstaff ignore customers, and make rude comments to people throughout the restaurant.  She never came over to offer drink refills or to check on us. With a more friendly waitstaff I am sure this place would do better.",2.0,0
"We were looking forward to a nice Sunday breakfast and decided to venture over to Housatonic to check out this new place.  The atmosphere is nice and the menu has lots to recommend.  We had read the reviews before heading over and were put off by the complaints of poor service but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I'm not sorry we did, but feel compelled to add to the chorus.There were only a few tables occupied when we arrived and yet we had to wait for what seemed to be too long to be seated.  The brunch menu is very straightforward.  Nice additions to the regular brunch fare are crepes although we didn't try them.  There are lots of add-ons on the bottom of the menu but all lacking price, a practice I don't care for.We settled on coffee, eggs etc.  Paid extra for toast and croissant.  The waitress wrote down toast and an english muffin (go figure) and this was served to us with our eggs, dry with no butter.  Coffee was terrible.  That would have been OK in a regular roadside diner but not in a restaurant that prides itself as being a ""coffee house.""  Our waitress never returned to see how things were and we had to flag down another employee to correct the english muffin vs. croissant mistake and to get some butter for the toast before it was too cold. So, in a nutshell: will we return? Maybe, but not likely.  To be fair- the eggs, potatoes and bacon were all done nicely, that said, there are way too many other local places to enjoy that are run much better.  By the time we left the place was full.  Most tables had not received their orders and there were a number of people waiting to get in.  I'm guessing a lot of these folks were also first-timers.  I could be wrong.",2.0,0
"Love this place! I knew Craig, from when he had his little cafe in NYC, and was sad to learn that he was no longer there. However, after some light stalking, and a four and a half hour drive from Ithaca, it was totally worth it. The food is top quality, and super fresh. I got to snack on freshly picked cherries and black berries while waiting for my meal, which was amazing. My mom and I split the croissant sandwich and the fruit pancakes, and inhaled every crumb. Oh, and the space is packed with tons of antiques for purchase or simply just to appreciate. Very nice ambiance, delicious, fresh food made with love, and an owner who puts his soul into every tiny detail. Definitely a gem!",5.0,1
"We came in on Christmas day just when it was closing and the owner (who is also the chef) was very kind to us and let us dine there anyway. My husband had brandied cherry pancakes and I had the spinach and goat cheese crepe. They were DIVINE! Then he gave us a complimentary sweet crepe with egg nog ice-cream and fruit, drizzled with chocolate on top. Again, another dish we were blown away by. By that point we were like two happy stuffed Christmas geese but the tastebud fun didn't stop there. The owner gave us two complimentary hot chocolates and brought us out to the the back gazebo area outfitted with a wood burning stove and chatted with us a bit. You couldn't find a more generous, genuine, nice guy and 5-star New York city quality food.  Definitely worth a stop if you're staying in the Berkshires. I only wish the place was in my neighborhood in NY-I'd be there every day!!",5.0,1
"We had dinner at Pleasant and Main Friday night. This is such a great place -- the food, the dining room, the service and the price. Craig, the host, directed us to the backyard following dinner. He had lit a fire in the Vermont Castings stove. Do not be discouraged if the dining room has too many empty tables. It is only because not enough people have caught onto Craig's wonderful hospitality and food.",5.0,1
"What a find. As we drove passed, I immediately wanted to turn around! We had just had a late breakfast so we were only going to look around the ""store"" right in the cafe! We were immediately welcomed and shown the ever so quaint fire pit area with a grand view of the hills. We were so smitten that we decided to stay for apple cider and a pumpkin muffin. Both were amazing! What gracious hosts, good food, and inviting ambience! A must try!",5.0,1

"As a fan of the old Jack's, I was happy to see the space being used again.  Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed.  Maybe based on the reviews it's a better place for breakfast, but we went for dinner and was not impressed.The service was really terrible.  Our waitress seemed distracted and kept forgetting things.  We asked for more butter, she forgot. We were never offered anything to drink, we had to ask for water.  4 of us were getting soup. 3 came and then the table next to us (arrived after us) got their soup.  We asked  the manager (I'm assuming that was who he was) and he said without any apology and clearly annoyed ""It's coming!""  Actually, it wasn't.  When we finally asked again for more butter, it was brought, and placed right next to the empty one with empty butter wrappers.  This is waiting tables 101 (this was the manger guy too).  Remove the dirty crap when you bring something new.  (half our dirty silverware and butter plates were strewn around the table when we were eating dessert.)  the place was not at all crowded.  Maybe 4 tables.  Then there was some other guy floating around all night (another manager? the owner?).  His purpose I could not figure out at all as he served no purpose and was an eyesore in his ripped up jeans.   Oh, there is a nice garden out back except one of the employees was smoking out there and well, that was gross.  Oh yeah, we had heard that the roast beef dinner was good, but by 7:30 on a Friday night they were all out.  When we asked if they were substituting anything for it (this is community/prix fixe menu), the waitress seems dumbfounded that we would ask.  I wanted to love it, but they need to get their act together in the service department, because the food we did get was actually pretty good.  Except, please no sourdough buns on a burger.  I'm from San Francisco so I can appreciate sourdough, but on a burger is not the place.",1.0,0
"This is my favorite restaurant in the Berkshires - It is a very special place - don't miss it.  My husband and I have been there for the Community supper two times while on vacation in Stockbridge (ten minutes away) - in June and September 2016.  Fantastic food - delicious - great menu - hard to choose choices.  It is unique - great retro/vintage decor - fresh wild flowers on every table - background music this week was Opera and French songs - and Craig, the owner and the chef is beyond fantastic - highly recommend - can't wait to return.

Amazing little country cafe off the beaten path in Housatanic. The place doubles as an antique shop. The decor is nostalgic and the food is amazing. The service is friendly and prompt.

"Such a disappointment. We came here today because of the multiple 5 star reviews, as well as delicious looking pictures. We were not happy. Our eggs Benedict were overcooked, which I have NEVER experienced in a restaurant before. The sausages and bacon seemed like leftovers reheated, and were not tasty. We didn't even try the home fries - they also looked days old and mushy. The crepes we ordered were supposed to have Nutella - they did not have Nutella, but over-doused in a chocolate syrup. The raspberries were moldy. The food did not come out at once, so our kids had to sit and watch us eat while their individual plates came out one at a time. The waitress had a lot of trouble understanding what we were saying - we were surprised our order was actually right. Not sure if it was an off day, but it was such a disappointment. I want my $45 back. I only gave it a 2, because the decor was really fun, and it helped keep the kids entertained.",2.0,0
"Arrived with a party of 7 and they were out of 2 of their 3  famous Prix Fix dinners.  The salmon cakes were actually pink hockey pucks. Never offered a beverage ( no wine).

"This review does not include a review of the food. There's good reason for that.  We went for lunch and sat waiting for our food for nearly an hour.  Although that was obviously not good, the reason for the 1 star (and that's only because Yelp does not provide a zero star option) was the terrible service from our waitperson and terrible attitude from the manager.  Not once during our lengthy wait did our server or the manager stop by the table to either refill drinks or to simply apologize for the delay and keep us apprised of the progress of our order.  When we finally hailed the manager and let her know that we had been left alone and waiting for almost an hour without our food (a simple lunch order of sandwiches) she didn't apologize, but did go check with the kitchen.  Upon her return, she told us that our order had not yet even been started, again without hinting at an apology. At that point I told her that the wait was bad enough, but that what bothered us most was being ignored for almost an hour.  Her response was to sarcastically say (and this is pretty much verbatim) ""Oh, no!  You weren't left alone.  You seemed to be enjoying yourself with conversation.""  That did it.  My father put me through college and law school working as a bartender.  I've worked as a bus boy.  I know how hard it is to be a server and how many times you have to deal with jerks.  I thus have a soft spot for servers, particularly when it comes to sins of the kitchen, which are generally not their fault.  But when a server (or, especially, a manager) is an unmitigated jerk, watch out.  I have no patience for someone who should value my business being an a-hole, particularly when I'm in the right and being reasonable. Upon hearing her idiotic response, I simply told the manager that we would go on enjoying ourselves at another restaurant.  We told her not to bother starting our order and left (but only after being charged for the sodas we had during the wait, another sign of customer service). My only regret in leaving was that if we had toughed it out a little while longer our lunch would have turned into dinner and we would have been able to order their turkey dinner special, which is served only at that time.  I guess I'll have to wait till Thanksgiving, because I'm not ever coming back here.  If this is the type of service he is happy offering, perhaps the owner should consider changing the name of his restaurant to NOT-SO-PLEASANT AND MAIN.",1.0,0
"Visited for the first (but not the last!) time last night.  Excellent pot roast served with real mashed potatoes and fresh vegetables.  Obviously, they are still working out the service kinks, but all the staff was friendly and accommodating.  For example, we were seated without menus and it took awhile for someone to notice we didn't have them.  Seated next to us (and before us) was a charming couple who generously shared their bottle of wine with us.  For now it is BYOB.    Our server took our order before theirs and we got our meals first.  Not a big thing, but it might have been to some people!  We were treated to some delicious extras.  Looking forward to trying breakfast.",4.0,1
"Had a great breakfast (omelet, muffin, croissant, potatoes, salad) and a mediocre dinner. I was so thrilled with the breakfast that I just had to return to see what they did with dinner. The angel hair pasta with scallops was richly flavored (but my friend's version had overcooked pasta) and delicious, but the portion was small, and I was still hungry when my plate was empty. It is worth noting that I am not a big eater. Come on guys, pasta? It's very cheap, so you shouldn't skimp. And I couldn't fill up on bread because the Parker House-style rolls served at the beginning of the meal were awful - like they came packaged from the supermarket. We decided to get dessert because we were still hungry, and we both chose the brownie sundae - usually a foolproof dessert anywhere. This was horrible. There was no brownie - instead a piece of dry, flavorless cake that looked like it was cooked in a loaf pan. It had none of the fudgy flavor or texture that is essential to a good brownie. So disappointing. I will return for lunch or breakfast, but not dinner. Too bad because the place is very charming.",3.0,0
